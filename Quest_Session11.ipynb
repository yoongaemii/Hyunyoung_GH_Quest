All of us expected a certain level of service since we were staying at the Ritz, however this hotel certainly didn't meet what we would consider Ritz standards.  The rooms were fine. They were clean with well appointed bathrooms, but nothing to get excited about. The service however was awful. The first night we were there, I made -- calls to the bell man, before someone in hotel communications picked up the phone. Then on Saturday night before we left for dinner at -:--, we requested to have extra hotels delivered to our room and our trash removed. When we returned at --:--, neither request was fullfilled. I made another call to housekeeping and then finally things were taken care of. In my opinion, for the rates we were paying, we should have had nightly turn down service.  I did speak with a manager when we checked out and he said he would make it worth our while to return, however all we received was a letter of apology.  Needless to say, we have no plans to return to this hotel. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Boston in February of ---- and had a wonderful stay. The service there was impeccable as is service at all the Four Seaons that I have stayed at. If you are willing to pay Ritz Carlton prices, then I would recommend staying at the Four Seasons instead!\",\n",

I particularly enjoyed the wine-tasting evenings & the helpful, polite front desk.  Overall, I'd recommend this place for singles or couples, but for children present, you probably need a bit bigger room. For the location & proximity to everything (including a marvelous little Mexican restaurant around the corner), you can't beat this place for the price. SF is a magical city with plenty of things to do, so I'd recommend just crashing here & seeing the wonderful surroundings more than hanging out in a room all day.

Grand Central Station is a short walk and gets you to other places you can't get to by walking (cheaper than yellow cabs - although you should also give this a go. We booked a cab with the hotel to take us back to the airport upon our departure and we got a limo - what a way to leave New York! This was certainly better than our inward travel. Got a transfer just outside the airport and spent -- minutes driving between terminals collecting other fares before arriving back at our original terminal and heading off to our hotel.  Our room was on a top floor high which was great as it meant less traffic and street noise. We had some problems with the heater in our room but the reception staff eventually resolved this by providing us with a portable heater.  We did not eat at the hotel at all because diners and deli's are available in close proximity. The best meals we found were in China Town and at Planet Holywood. If you are planning to go to Planet Hollywood negotiate a travel within the main section of the restaurant before being shown to your table otherwise you may end up like us on the top floor overlooking the action and not in it.  We took part in typical tourist activities such as Ripleys and the CSI Experience. Disappointed with both unfortunately. Had hoped to see a broadway play but we left it to late and the only available tickts were $--- each. If you ant to get to the to of the Empire State bilding would suggest going early as the queue by mid-day will take at least an hour. The boat trips around New York are great and the best way to see the Statue of Liberty, The Brooklyn Bridge etc.  Make sure you book the ---- Memorial at reception. Although very emotional it gives you a true understanding of the events which took place and an appreciation for life and the spirit of New Yorkers.  The store window displays, Xmas trees and ice skating rings are just amazing over Xmas. Ice skating on Xmas Eve on Xmas day was definetely a highlight and the Hot Chocolate with marshmallows and whipped cream is wonderful. Do be careful if paying for a padlock for the lockers. I forgot where ours was and soehow managed to gain access to someone elses ;-(  Stumbling across Times Square one evening whilst taking a stroll was enlightening literally. All of a sudden he colour of the sky was bright. There are so many illuminated signs and this area has a real buzz at night time. Didn't care too much for the hoards of people here during the day though.  We did use the hotel bar on our last evening. The bar man was nice and friendly. The bar room was a little odd and resembled a chapel or such like.  We were surprised at just how many people there were and how many shops remained open on Xmas day. This really is the town that does not sleep.  Our only regret was not having longer than - days but there is always next time.\",\n",

Also just off the walk of fame is a shopping mall with shops like Gap, Superdry, etc. There are also a few restaurants there as well. For anyone who likes pizzas I would recommend visiting the California Pizza Kitchen at the mall - pizzas are lush there and are rasonably priced. We got a shared bus to the hotel through Super Shuttle. It cost approx $-- return and pick ups occur every ----- mins from airport. Be warned of the way they drive tho, it was a slightly frightening experience after -- hours on a plane!   We didnt have a car there so did all organised tours, one through VIP tours and one through Starline Tours.

       " \"The service was fine, but the hotel itself fell way below my expectations from such a respectable establishment as Hilton. They were nickel-and-diming me all the way.   -. The carpet in the corridor is not very clean and it smelled weird there. The pool area was no better - actually, much worse. I wouldn't recommend going barefoot anywhere in that area. It's just dirty.  -. The coffee maker in the room was broken - it made --- cup of coffee and then turned off. So if you want a full cup, you have to ask it - times. Of course, by then the cup is almost all cold. Good luck making tea with it, if you don't like ice tea.  -. Once we have used the provided tea packs, room service didn't bother to replace them. Probably saved them a cent or so.  -. There's no free internet access in the business center and no free printing. I am staying in various hotels a lot and wasn't used before to being charged dollar-a-minute for printing a simple page of driving directions. I was used to getting it for free, as it was in most hotels of this class I visited. Hilton, however, decided to save yet another ---- of a cent.  -. Most hotels provide some sort of paper for the guests to write on. Hilton has post-it notes. Literally - tiny squares of paper, and that's it. If you want to write down something that's not - words - good luck, Hilton is not going to help, go find an Office Depot and buy it yourself. Here, another cent saved for Hilton.   -. Parking pricing is outrageous - I've parked cheaper in San-Francisco downtown, no discounts or anything for hotel guests - but don't expect that to mean easy and convenient parking. Parking lot is crammed, and spending -- minutes looking for a random place somebody didn't notice, or trying to fit your car into the space that nobody dared to use because it's too small - is routine. All while a bunch of spaces stay empty - but general public is not allowed there, probably so that they can charge you ---% for valet parking in the same spot, in addition to the outrageous price paid for the parking - which a lot of hotels of this class provide for free. In Hilton, I not only got charged for it - I got charged twice in one of the days. They can't even make their system work properly.  Summarily, the personnel of the hotel was very nice, welcoming and pleasant. They did what they could. However, the hotel itself fell below the expectations - I paid more than I expected to pay for less than I expected to get from Hilton. I understand the economy is tough and everybody has to save, but saving on a couple of sheets of paper and a couple of tea bags is too much for me. When I go to a brand-name hotel like Hilton I don't expect that. After this stay I would think twice - no, a dozen times - before ever staying at a Hilton establishment again. Hope the savings were worth it.\",\n",

This is where the good things ended.  The room had issues. Initially, the phone in the living room did not work. They sent someone up to fix the phone, and then some --- hours later it just started randomly producing high pitched beeps (which in turn woke me up). In addition, the guest compendium was empty (as in someone had removed the pages). It took - phone calls and - people to come up to my room to actually understand what I was requesting, and deliver a full compendium.  I also had cause to contact and visit the front desk at various stages later in the evening during my stay. To say the night staff were next to useless would be an over-statement. The night manager basically said nothing to my requests, or as little as possible. They treated me like I was putting them out of their way and disrupting them being lazy. One particular staff member was so bad I wrote a separate complaint to Hilton about them.  I also witnessed a lady in obvious distress attempting to get a room late one evening. When they informed her she was not able to get a room without photo ID she became upset and aggravated. She ranted a little bit about \\'if I get murdered tonight, it\\'ll be on your conscious\\' to which the night manager replied \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"That\\'s ok Ma\\'am, I have no conscious\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\".

My only issue was trying to do online check-in for our flight from our room and not being able to follow the instructions for printing our boarding passes.

       " \"I very much wanted to stay at a boutique hotel near Times Square in lieu of a Hilton or Marriott type. After some research, hubby and I compromised on The Paramount after seeing the price of their modern chic rooms on the website. When we checked in we were both excited about the impressive lobby. Very us. BUT we were royally disappointed when we entered our King Deluxe room. Womp womp womp...  I'm normally a very flexible-laid back, go with the flow gal but this just wasn't what I was expecting at all.  The pictures seemed to be photo shopped bright and welcoming on the website. In reality, the room was entirely too small and the bathroom lacked a lot of luster. The room just seemed so dark and small. Just NOT what we had in mind for our - night NYC experience. The money spent renovating this hotel was obviously poured into the more public areas of the hotel. The closet would better be described as a compartment to store ~- jackets so our suitcases took up the little floor space we had.  We headed downstairs and explained our concerns and requested upgrade options. I inquired about their Entertainment and Couture suites displayed on their website as they are the only ones displayed. Do you know what they told me?! The available suites displayed on their website are only used for corporate events and fashion shoots. I was dumbfounded. I encouraged them to provide keys to the suite that they DO have available for purchase so that I can see it before we accept the upgrade for an additional $--- for our - nights in NYC. We saw it and it was another womp womp womp. They had simply take a wall and corned off - rooms at the end of the hallway. Even the rooms still had the heavy secure hotel door separating the bedroom from the living room AND the exit sign still existed in the cornered off wasted space in the entrance of the suite. The bedroom in the suite had a double bed. My husband and I are very tall and we by no means intend to share a double bed while paying for a suite. Desperately trying to see the positive, I looked out the window to see if our view had been upgraded. View from Times Square? It had been a bit but a partial view of lights from Times Square and the back of a billboard just wasn't worth it to me. Womp womp womp.  We headed back downstairs, handed them the suite key and stated that we will only be spending - night at The Paramount and would be checking out the following day. (Obviously, it was too late to cancel our room that night and not pay a fee, etc.) The customer service was very kind so I hadn’t the heart to share my disappointment. I'm sure it was obvious by our actions at that point.  I've attached a picture of my hubby stretching out his hands so that you get an idea of just how small the King Deluxe room is. Note our luggage covering the entire opposite side of the bed. No point in showing you the view out the window, it was the back of a building.  If you care to know:  NYC was insanely booked everywhere last week. We did manage to secure - nights at The Bowery (LOVED it, ---% guarantee that we will return) and the - other nights of our trip were spent at the Marriott on Times Square with an incredible view of Times Square.\",\n",

In the lobby-reception area, there was a table set up with ice water, coffee, etc., which was very convenient and appreciated. There is a little sitting area off of the check-in area with brochures galore, so you can sit & relax, drink coffee & look at brochures. Adjacent to this is the place where they serve breakfast. They really do serve a nice breakfast, waffles, etc. The hotel rooms are nice. Nothing fancy, but pretty spacious, clean and comfortable. Overall for the money, I thought I did pretty well in booking this hotel. Good value for the money.',\n",

The quality, size, quietness, and location of the room was supurb. Every staff member was friendly and willing to help. Complimentary wine reception every evening was a definite plus. We felt comfortable from the moment we arrived and were reluctant to leave. The Muse is a calm oasis in the bustle of New York City. As a Kimpton InTouch member we were upgraded automatically to a superior king room. It was large well appointed and quiet with a view down --th street. The bed was extremely comfortable. They just began a complete renovation of the lobby so there may be some inconvenience until it is completed. Our only bad experience was the District Restaurant. We ate there Sunday for breakfast. Service was mediocre, the bacon and eggs were both overcooked and it was tremendously over priced. Such a fine hotel should not have such a bad restaurant. Other than that I would recommend this hotel very highly.',\n",

Our room wasn't ready but we were told that since the housekeeping staff began at -:--am, and that the guests previously in our room had already checked out, that our room would be ready for us by --:--am. We went to breakfast and returned at --:-- and were told that our room was still not ready. We waited another ninety minutes and checked back with the front desk and were told that they would put a rush on our room with housekeeping, that they were in the process of cleaning it, and to come back in a half an hour. We did, and the room still wasn't ready. By that time we were both exhausted and perhaps the front desk person took pity on us and upgraded us to a junior suite.   The room was quite large especially for New York hotel rooms. We had views of the street from two sides, which we enjoyed, but it was noisy. It didn't bother us, but I think it would wake up a light sleeper. The bed was comfortable and the reading lights had dimmers. The desk was large and had a power strip.  We chose this hotel over the other InterContinental in New York City because of the price, location, and previous reviewer's glowing comments. There were a few little details that just didn't compare with previous experience we've had with this hotel brand.  The furniture looked a bit shabby with scuff marks on the table and tired looking furniture, chipped paint. The bathroom had a light fixture hanging loosely from the ceiling. There was some mold on the ceiling in the shower area. There were a couple of times that I had to wait over five minutes for hot water in the bathroom and the bathroom sink had a constant drip. One of our towels had a large hole in it. I know it sounds like nit-picking, but I've become accustomed to a certain level of expectations when staying at an InterContinental hotel, and for the reasons above, the Barclay didn't meet those expectations, in my opinion.\",\n",

The hotel staff was wonderful, particularly Michael O and Michael K.

For a five-star, it fell short in a couple of areas...  There was a large, very gross looking yellow stain on the comforter. We had to ask that they bring a new one. Not a pleasant sight.  Also, a couple of guys on the bell staff were blatantly ogling my girlfriend as we were walking to the elevator...very tacky. Granted, she's very attractive but you would think the staff would have a little more class than that.  All in all, great place and we would highly recommend.\",\n",

The staff in other areas were mostly courteous and professional but the bar staff was wooden and unhelpful. The room itself was a decent size but not big. Furnishing were comfortable enough. The internet was unbelievably slow and had to call the hotel's IT department - times to troubleshoot problems. Not acceptable as they charge $-- a day for internet service. If you use the valet service, expect to wait upwards of -- minutes whenever you want your car. Returning in the evening after dinner, waited about -- minutes to be acknowledged by a member of the valet team. The staff seemed to smile alot but lacked any substantive abilities when dealing with any issues. Had a minor problem with my booking that took far longer than necessary to resolve as the staff were dense and difficult to talk to, as though it were their first day on the job. This hotel seems a magnet for conferences but I couldn't recommend this place for business or leisure purposes. There are much better choices for the money they charge.\",\n",

Although Hampton Inn is on the lower end of the Hilton family, this particular hotel out does many higher ranked chains by providing a well managed facility with great touches like free wireless, free hot and cold breakfast and a young but highly trained staff.   The only con about the hotel is the parking. It is costly to park any where in downtown denver but this is true for any metropolitan area. The proximity of this hotel to interesting locations nearby for fun and dining makes it worth the extra cash to have a place to park.   Highly recommended.',\n",

This room has a Victorian tiled ensuite shower room which looked lovely and functioned perfectly  We enjoyed the breakfast of homebaked scone and a choice of cooked bacon and eggs.   You'll love this place if you appreciate period details and individual flavour. If you want all mod cons like a coke machine, coffee makers and trad American breakfasts then it isn't for you.   We walked to Bilboa Park and the zoo but didn't explore enough in the evening to find a restaurant to recommend - it seems a quiet neighbourhood.

When my boyfriend and I arrived after a - hour flight from NY, we were happy that the Inn is located only -- minutes from the airport by taxi. The hotel is located on the second floor of a steakhouse, with no elevator and no bellhop, so we had to carry our bags up a flight and a half of stairs. (I knew about this from the reviews, but after a long flight I had forgotten!) The woman at the front desk was very helpful, even leaving to personally check if the room was ready because we had arrived early for check-in. It was, and she gave us a large cold bottle of Evian, a goodie bag with large cookies and a CD, and a short tour of our room and its amenities. We were also given - room keys, which is helpful.   The room was a suite (they are all suites) facing -st Avenue. The bed looked like one large pillow and it was amazingly soft and comfortable. We had to force ourselves, after testing it, to get up and do some exploring around town. The room had a --\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" TV which came in handy because we were there to see the Seahawks VS. Giants that Sunday at Quest Field Stadium, so we were able to keep track of the teams and highlights on a picture-perfect TV. The bathroom had a stall shower and was pretty basic - hairdryer, lots of towels, and complimentary toileties. The room closet had a dresser, iron and board, and - ultra-soft bathrobes. There was also a seperate coffee-office closet which was pretty convenient, yet out of the way. And the leather sofa and chair were nice, as well. The most useful thing in the room was the pile of Seattle guides on the sofa table. We used that to find all the restaurants for our entire stay.   The Inn is located only a half mile from Seattle Center (with Space Needle) and less than a mile striaight down -st to Pike Market. It\\'s only a little further to Pioneer Square and Quest Field Stadium. And it\\'s only - blocks away from the Seattle Port. First Avenue has an abundance of restaurants and shops so you won\\'t have to worry about taking a taxi to dinner. (There\\'s even a big umbrella for you in the room closet, just in case you have to take a short walk in the rain!)   Overall, we were so happy with our choice that when we go back to Seattle for whatever reason, we will be staying there. The location, the comfort, the moderate price ($--- a night in Seattle is hard to beat) and the friendliness of the female employees made it a perfect stay!',\n",

Back to the hotel room,we specified a room with mountain views and got a nice one. Large large bathroom with separate tub and bath appointed with marble floors and granite countertops. rooms facing west in the summer, you might want to leave your AC a little lower before you leave for dinner.

Check-in was smooth and fast, and the staff were courteous and knowledgeable. The lobby is nicely decorated in a contemporary style, but the building sure shows its age once one heads up to the guestroom floors. The woodwork outside our room was so battered looked as if someone had been hacking at it with an ax.   On the positive side, I liked the overal design of the room, and the bedding was of nice quality. But there were some serious flaws. The bathroom cabinet was cracked so severely that some of the wood veneer had copletely fallen off. And, although I asked for a nonsmoking room, the place smelled strongly of smoke. We are not smokers and didn't spend any time with smokers during our trip, but our clothes absorbed the smell from the room. When we got home and unzipped our suitcases, the smell of smoke was extremely strong. I had to dryclean the brand new overcoat that I had just purchased that very weekend at Saks.  Other positives about this hotel are the location. It was very convienient to Magnificent Mile shopping and attractions. The cafe attached served great coffee, and I never waited more than a couple of minutes for my order. And, again, the staff were helpful and pleasant.   Overall, the room was a good value, but the the stay would have been much more pleasant if this hotel made some basic maintenance efforts.\",\n",

They may have mentioned that detail on the website, but I still think the Kimpton management could negotiate a better contract or reduce the overhead fee. Parking for one night added an extra --% to my overall cost. The lobby is crisp and decorated in modern style-color scheme with unique lucite bubble chairs. The decor didn\\'t have much of an effect on my mood, since the mod furniture and walls were predominately upholstered in aubergine and burgundy shades of vinyl. I guess it just wasn\\'t my taste, though the eye catching details could be perceived as young and fresh.  Upon check-in at -:-- pm, the friendly receptionist informed me that my room was not ready due to cleaning (?!) but that I could be upgraded to a suite. Softening the blow was the fact that I had arrived just before wine hour, which, according to my research is a standard Kimpton perk. Sweet. After pushing my way past a bellhop carriage stacked with supply boxes, I waited for the elevator in the narrow corridor. On the --th floor, my spacious suite greeted me with the stale smell of cigarette smoke-as though it had formerly been a smoking room (though Kimpton properties are smoke-free as the room placard informed me, this hotel recently changed management). The area rug that overlayed the carpeting was askew. This wasnt necessarily a sign of uncleanliness but probably that nobody checked the room before my arrival. The rest of the room was exceptional: crisp Sferra linens on the bed and duvet, a clean bathroom with a large soaking tub and designer shower that were consistent with the other elements. After a quiet and comfortable night\\'s rest, I took advantage of the complimentary coffee bar in the lobby. The brew was exceptional-was encouraged to take a second cup to-go, as well as a bottle of water. Detail-oriented hospitality was top-notch, and I have no doubt that the staff would go out of their way to assist any guest. Due to time constraints, I wasn\\'t able to enjoy the rooftop pool and bar that are features of the property. Overall rating: ----. Be sure to check AAA and government rates if you qualify.',\n",

The hotel is quaint. Older buildings which have been merged to house the rooms. Very good service from check in to check out. At night, a bar is beside the lobby area with comfortable seating. Very relaxing space. As for the room, I was a large room with a King bed. Clean. The bed was very comfortable with crisp linens. Decor was fresh. View out of the window was the brick wall of the building next door. Did not bother me as I was only in the room to sleep and do some end of the day work. The bath was also very good size with a walk in shower....very nice. Another reviewer noted the rain head for the shower and low pressure. I will take the other side of the commentary. The pressure in the shower was very good and I loved the oversized rain head. If you did not like the downward stream, you could direct it slightly to get more of a traditional shower experience. I liked it so much, I am adding one to my soon the be remodeled bath. The only negative about the shower was the caulking had some mold.

We were upgraded to the Penthouse level (yay Hyatt rewards program!). Oh-em-gee .... a roof patio! The room was gigantic - especially by NY standards. The lounge is awesome and I'm in love with their espresso machine. The concierge was very helpful and we had a few ideas where we wanted to dine the last night and Eataly was great experience. She suggested it for a unique experience over the hotel restaurant.   Most of all - the staff went above and beyond. Jordan was so awesome - he handled our check in (room wasn't quite ready, so he had us relax in the lounge while he handled check in) and he risked life and limb during an epic thunderstorm on our -nd day to score us a taxi to get to an appointment on time.

The workout center was in need of more ventilation (older building - window a-c units), and it is a little small, but they have what you need: cardio machines, free weights and a bench, and a multi-station weight machine. You can also purchase access to a nearby club. The sign in the workout center does suggest that before exercising, you speak with your physician and follow *his* advice. They need to update their signage, clearly.  Otherwise, really nice. I will likely stay here again.\",\n",

We had a PL reservation, tried to check in at --am for a king size was told by the friendly lady in the front desk none available right now, will reserve one for me for -pm and asked for my cell phone in case one is available before that, she'll call me.   We drop our luggage off and went to eat lunch at Darren's Cafe, then walked around the Wharf. At around -pm, she called me and said our room is available which surprised me b-c I didn't expect she'll really call me back and I'll have to go back at -pm to check-in.  Room was ---, on the other end from the elevators overlooking Columbus street. It's a quick - min walk from the elevator to the room, we didn't mind the walk since we're young but older folks might not like this walk from-to the elevator. Room was decent size, looks like recently renovated, thin walls, small bathroom. Since Columbus is a busy street, you'll hear buses and garbage trucks in the early morning. It didn't bother me that much, I grew up in Brooklyn where our house was next to a major highway. A couple of buses and a garbage truck is nothing compare to back home.  We didn't come to SF for the hotel, our favorite part of the Marriott is it's location. Within walking distance you're in the Wharf where you'll find Hollywood Cafe (excellent breakfast place), Walgreens, IHOP, Barnes and Noble, Hooter's, Dennys, Gary Danko (make reservations early), Bike Rental shops, In-N-Out Burgers, The Cannery, Bouldin Bakery, etc... Skip the rental car, I know they want $---night for parking here, the hotel is next to several bus stops (hence the noise) and - blocks from the F-line tram (in front of the Walgreens).  Overall we enjoyed our stay here, thanks to the friendly staff, we wouldn't mind staying here again.\",\n",

I don't eat pork and I was able to get cheese eggs. The free internet was crazy fast. Checking in and out was a breeze. The entire staff was very helpful and I would stay again.   The Bad - I arrived -:-- (-- mins early) although check-in is -pm. I didn't mind the room was not ready then but was bothered that it was not ready until -:-- (-- mins late). The heater is not central based meaning you have to control it yourself and the vent was extremely loud. I opted many times to just not run it because it was just too loud to sit through.   The Ugly - After coming in one night, there were people hanging out next to the elevator and wall with no shoes on. I assume they were maybe taking a break from their room however the hotel does have a lobby for that. It was not a good site to see shoe-less guests hanging out on the wall and at the elevator. On my last night, I was awaken at -am by rude guest who had been [--] the entire trip. After going back to sleep, I was then awaken by hammering. The hotel is renovating a little. I was also charged for local calls after being told they were free.

It was when you entered the lifts that the bright and airy feel dissapeared. The lift was very nice and oppulent but dark, once up to the --th floor, we were met with a very dark, slightly creepy in a nice way corridor.

The bath towels and robes were light and fluffy and the tioletries were replaced everyday. The soaps they use a lovely too, and WOW what a great shower.   The room itself had a very large flat screen TV mounted on the wall, we also had a floor to ceiling mirror on one wall and floor to ceiling windows. The bed was super-king size and the bed was very comfortable. As we are super fussy on bed quality we did make sure the beds were pillow-top and it was like a big marshmellow.

On the other hand, the location near the convention center and other restaurants and shops is ideal for those who like to walk and explore during their trips. (Tip: Listen to the SD natives who kind of look askance when the idea of visiting Old Town is the topic. We didn't take their advice and ended up being seriously underwhelmed by Old Town and its surroundings. Instead, visit Coronado Island if you have a free afternoon during your conference. Those few hours along the beach and walking through the town on a sunny afternoon were the most memorable and pleasant of all during our SD stay.)

What a joke!!!   My bed wasn\\'t even a full, it was more like a double... maybe even a twin-and-a-half. My wife and I, who sleep in a King at home, were practically on top of each other. And the courtyard view, looked more like the view from a project in Brooklyn. And, I understand that the interior rooms in the hotel have no choice but to have a view like that, but please don\\'t tell me it\\'s an upgrade, when it really isn\\'t. I would have rather heard the train and had a view of the outside world, than to feel like I was in prison.  The room was tiny!

There was exactly enough room to turn around, but that was about it. there was a lounge chair in the corner that was unecessary in that size room and the desk where one could use a laptop was at the foot of the bed. When you pulled the chair out to take a seat, it hit the foot of the bed, so you had to squeeze into the space between the desk and the chair.

The bathroom was also very tiny, but it had a full-sized tub and a fantastic shower head. Also, the little Bliss sample products were great so I purchased full-sized versions. The toilet was extremely noisy, but I believe I figured out why. The flush was a little longer and stronger than a usual toilet, but I think it was so that all \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"debris\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" could be cleaned with one flush instead of possibly flushing more than once.

I didn\\'t see a handicapped button you can push to open it automatically.  The location is decent. You\\'re very close to the Orange and Brown line trains, two blocks from the Blue line and - or - blocks from the Red line.

The bed was firm but comfortable, the closet and drawers provided plenty of storage space, and the lighting could be adjusted from subtle to extremely bright as needed.   We visited the bar and ordered a cheese plate (rather plain) and drinks (fresh and delicious). The prices were typical for a hotel bar but the service was friendlier and more attentive than most we've visited. The bar is small but open to the street so there was still plenty to see.  While we stayed here we visited MOMA and attended a concert at the Beacon Theater. We had no problems walking from the hotel to the subway or nearby destinations. We did check our luggage at the front desk for a short period and had no trouble retrieving it later.\",\n",

But really if you are going to New York why would you want to spend all your time in your room. This hotel is not great for business people it is a trendy chic boutique hotel in Manhattan.  I would reccommend any brit to use this hotel, just for the location and beds alone.  The shower was lush !!! Just what I needed after walking all day and night.  The room service was brill (brits - all the freebies you can fit into your suitcase) the shampoo soap etc was lush !!! I still have some and it is brill.

Parking is covered and convenient and the neighbourhood is safe and quiet.  The staff were wonderful, especially Wyatt, who despite seeming to be doing every job under the sun when we were checking in, took time to accomodate our needs and was really smiley and helpful (as were all the staff we met without exception).  The room was lovely; a two room unit on the seventh floor overlooking the downtown area and the mountains. The bedroom was generously sized, the bed huge and comfortable and the a-c nice and chilly! The main living area shared both the view and balcony and was comfortably furnished. The bonus of it's former life as an appartment block is the sheer amount of space you get for your money - lovely to have been able to have really spread out.

The location is its biggest asset, but the room itself is not what I expected based on the pictures you have displayed on your website. The room was consistently hot no matter how low I adjusted the thermostat, the bathroom was a little outdated (based on what’s advertised on your website), and the cable TV had a distorted picture even after the Engineer tried to fix it. I had an issue with my billing on my room service and had to call several times to get it resolved (never received a call from front desk, they just slid an additional bill under my door) .I’m not trying to make comparisons, but I could have stayed in the Trump Tower for a couple hundred dollars more based on what I paid to stay at the property. They have a nice property, but to advertise it as a Four Star Hotel is misleading. I would have to compare it to a Springhill Suite or Holiday Inn Express just without a Concierge. This is not an attempt to bash the property, but to merely make one aware of how their website portrays an image that lacks just a bit of what is expected.',\n",

I was initially assigned a room directly above the restaurant, but the staff were very responsive to my request to move and arranged to move all my things while I was out the next day so my new, quieter room was ready for when I returned.   Staff were almost always very pleasant and made me feel very welcome when passing through the small foyer (which does not really lend itself to any gatherings-meetings beyond an initial meet up). Overall, the standard of service was excellent.   Food at the hotel's Firefly restaurant, and room service, was generally very good, although prices could have been more reasonable.   The location is only a hundred metres from Du Pont Circle and the surrounding bars, restaurants and shops.

Really a very nice overall experience -- the conference ran like clockwork, the catering for the conference was akin to a five star restaurant's, and I really really miss that pillowtop mattress and sunken tub. Luxury all the way. The Fairmont made this trip more like a vacation than a business conference. I was wary since I have read some reviews that gave the Fairmont less than stellar ratings on customer service, but I was very impressed.

Also no free wi-fi. :( The service is generally very good and the staff is friendly; however one day they did not clean our room until very, very late. The manager did call to apologize. The bar at the top floor has a nice view. Go there for a drink or two. We have stayed here twice and would stay again.',\n",
       " \"Ok...so we decided to stay here again. After all, the location is excellent and it was one of the best priced Marriott properties in the area. We are Marriott Rewards members and always try to seek out their properties when it is time to book a vacation.  This time we decided to book a corner room because from seeing photos, they have a better layout and far better kitchen-area seating. Plus you have more windows. We ended up in one on the --th floor with a view up -th Avenue where you could see the beginning of Central Park. Plus, we had a partial view of the Chrysler Building.  I'll start with what is good about this hotel. First of all, the front desk staff is very efficient, helpful and friendly. The free breakfast is quite adequate---decent food if nothing to write home about. Also, the maids who cleaned our room during the course of the week did a great job. It also appears that the bed sheets have improved---they are a much higher thread count than what was there previously.  So...how is it slipping? The furniture is starting to get shabby. The hotel is only - years old but hotel furnishings seem to take a real beating. The granite countertop on the kitchen table had some indelible stains. However, what really got to us is this --- everyday the towels and wash cloths smelled unclean and were dingy. Plus some were even ripped or looked flea-bitten. This was very off-putting. Also, the hot water tended to go out from time to time. During peak times when many are showering, it is understandable. However, when it's a time of day when most people are out, it's really inexcusable. Speaking of the plumbing---the toilet often had to be flushed twice---not good!  We never experienced these issues during our last stay two years ago. What's up with that? Is the hotel cutting corners when it comes to properly laundering the towels? Are the plumbing problems being worked on?  Would we stay here again? The verdict is still out on that one. What I'm going to do is closely monitor the reviews here to see if things improve. If they have, we certainly would stay again.\",\n",

They were quick in fixing it but it's still an issue. They also forgot our towels one day, though they did deliver new ones upon being told. Their website was also very inaccurate as it advertised free wireless internet in the common areas despite there being no such service. On top of that, they lacked a book of amenities in the room and did not provide one; being hungry at - AM and wishing for room service or some sort of map, we were unable to procure one. The website was also very unhelpful, lacking hours and locations of things.

They have a very nice lobby-lounge where they have complimentary drinks all day (and wine in the evening).

       " \"My son and I stayed here over spring break. I got a room here at a very good price - almost as low as the cost of a nearby hostel. The room was very clean. I read a few reviews that said the rooms were small, but considering the size of an apartment in NYC, I didn't think it was that small. We had two double beds, and if we had been traveling with a third person, we probably could have squeezed in a rollaway bed. The bathroom was very clean and looked like it had been recently updated.   A couple of cons - there was no screen on the window. We were on the --th floor and the window opened all the way, but there was no screen or any other safety feature. The bottom of the window is about -.- feet off the floor, so I kept having panic thoughts of my son (who was -- YEARS old at the time) tripping and falling out the window...a little paranoia there. lol However, I would not recommend this for someone traveling with a small child. Also, I could have sworn the rooms were advertised as having air conditioning. This one did not. I'm guessing they put window units in during the summer, but since it was still March, they hadn't put them in yet (it was unseasonably warm while we were there). That's just my guess, anyway.  The other thing that was a little odd was that the door lock looked like it had been broken before. I suppose if someone is really paraniod, this might be an issue. However, they have someone at the front desk -- hours a day. As a matter of fact, when you go out, they ask that you give them your room key and they will give it back when you return. Unheard of in this day, but it was kind of cool because you get to know the front desk people and they get to know you. They will ask for ID if they don't recognize you, but otherwise, they'll just give you your key. Again, I suppose if someone is super paranoid, this might be an issue, but I felt very safe there - more safe than staying at a motel with outside entry in the middle of nowhere.   Also, if you're not used to sleeping in a noisy city, I would recommend bringing ear plugs. The windows are super thin and you can hear traffic and people ALL NIGHT - it is only a couple of blocks from Time Square, so be prepared for traffic noise. I actually slept with a white noise track on my MP- player all night, and as soon as I dozed off, I didn't notice the noise anymore.  Aside from these small issues, I thought it was a great place, and I would definitely recommend it. They have a couple of nice lobby areas, one of which has a couple of dining tables, as well as a room with large lockers for rent for $-. That was great for us because we checked out at --am, but our flight didn't leave until -pm, so we locked up our luggage, went out to see a few more sights, came back and watched TV in the lobby for a while, then left.

The hotel is over-sized - probably -X the size of the Conrad. Almost reminds one of a Vegas-style hotel. The styling of the hotel is very modern-eclectic - it stands in sharp contrast to the more conservative and traditional Conrad styling. I personally prefer the Conrad but I\\'m sure others will prefer the JW. The JW lobby is loud and busy - Conrad is quiet and reserved.  The service was generally pretty good - however, the luggage did take over -- minutes to get to the room. I finally went down stairs to retrieve the luggage at which point the bell man brought it up. We did not order room service or eat at the restaurants so we got little exposure to the service other than the valet, which was fine.  The room view was spectacular. We were on the top floor and had an end room - two walls with floor to ceiling glass. Amazing. This is one area that the Conrad can not complete with JW - the views. Otherwise, the room was like the lobby - more modern in design. The office chair looks like something from my parents --\\'s kitchen. Take note: the bathroom does NOT have a tub - least not in our room. Also, the room did not have a couch (which you get at the Conrad) although there is room for one. But overall the room was very nice, beds were comfortable.  The pool is very small - smaller than Conrad and I do not like the \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"raised\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" design of the pool. Hot tub was nice sized and the excerise facility was very large. One area where the Conrad is obviously superior to the JW is the changing-shower facilities for the pools and excercise rooms. There is no comparison. Conrad feels like an exclusive golf club with dry-wet sauna, multiple showers, many free amenities etc. The JW feels like a public changing area with no saunas and few free amenities. The Conrad comes equipped with robes and they are nowhere in sight at the JW.   The presence of a Starbucks in the meetings area is a nice feature.  Overall, the new JW is a great new hotel in Indy but my vote is still that Conrad is a distant first. If you are an executive used to high-end treatment, it\\'s my opinion the JW probably will not quite satisfy like the Conrad.',\n",

Don't get me wrong, for a Hampton this is a nice place, but I've stayed at WAY nicer Hampton's in the past.   My room was a nice size and cleaned very nicely every day, but in need of an update (embedded grime in the bathroom, cracks in various places, etc.). The evening reception is a nice touch if you are ok with nachos and draft beer (not that there's anything wrong with that). The fitness facilities are in DESPERATE need of an update and are among the worst I've seen lately (Hilton rep's if you read this - please, please, please update the fitness facilities at the older Hamptons). The wi-fi was sketchy and dropped me off several times a night.  The area itself is lacking in food and shopping options. There are maybe - or - restaurants at this exit, all of which are fast food. You'll have to drive a few exits down to for a sit down meal and shopping of any sort.  All that said, the staff was very nice and the accomodations were acceptable.\",\n",

       " \"I just completed a --night stay at the Philadelphia Westin. This hotel was picked for me because it was across the street from the building where the office I was visiting was located. Good location for me, but I don't know if I'd pick this spot if I was a tourist. It was nice to be near the food court at the Liberty Place and the other restaurants around within walking distance, but most of the tourist stuff wasn't around where I was located.   The service was great. Everyone from the front door staff to the folks at the front desk to the people with guest services-room service were very nice. On a couple of different occasions, my room key failed to work, and the staff was great about having new cards programmed for me so I didn't have to wait too long. Prices through room service and down at the restaurant were a little steep, but probably not much different from other big cities.   In general, I'd say room cleanliness was pretty good. There were a couple of questionable stains on the wall near the bed, as well as a couple on sheets-pillowcases on certain days. Also, there was one day where I found a wash cloth with a red spot. I tossed it on the floor, assuming housekeeping would replace it. The next day when I picked up a new wash cloth from the counter, I found another red spot...surprisinly similar to the one from the previous day. No proof it was indeed the same...but no proof it wasn't.  The heavenly beds are still pretty good...not as fantastic as I remember from my last Westin stay, but since I wasn't getting a ton of sleep at night anyway, it wasn't really mattering much.  I had a corporate rate of $----night, which I guess isn't terrible, but if you're paying much over this, I think I'd look for something in a better part of town with more people out and about at night if that's your thing.\",\n",

       " 'We have stayed in the Charlotte area a number of times but never before at the Marriott City Center. The location suited our needs perfectly for this particular trip.   The check-in and bellman staff was exceptionally courteous and quite efficient. The lobby was attractive and well-maintained. Self-parking in the garage is not difficult once you navigate the very sharp and narrow curve in the entrance ramp. It felt reasonably safe and well lit. Our room was a bit small but certainly clean and comfortable and very reasonably priced given our discount (AAA, AARP, and Marriott- sponsored packages all work out to pretty much the same weekend discount).   BUT, and here is why I only rate our stay neutral and consider even that somewhat generous:  We were there on Friday and Saturday nights. Friday night we were awakened by extremely loud voices and laughter in the hallway right outside our room on an upper floor. I peeked out the security peephole and saw a group of well-dressed young people. they were calling to each other from doorway to doorway, down the hall, and generally behaving as though they were in a college dorm on a weekend night. I assume we were the unfortunate hallmates of people who had attended a very successful rehearsal dinner or other youth-oriented event where a lot of alcohol had been consumed and the reality of being in a grownup setting had been forgotten. I called the desk to complain and after five minutes the noise subsided somewhat, whether because the celebrants realized their behavior was unacceptable or because someone came up from the desk to tell them to be quiet I do not know.  Saturday night was much worse and something the hotel should have controlled. The relatively unobtrusive thumping music we had heard and ignored in the background Friday night had become a major annoyance, blasting up to our high-floor room for hours. We tried to go to sleep about --:--; it continued until after - a.m. Several times between - a.m. and - a.m. I called the desk and was told various things, among them that there had once been a club nearby that caused noise problems and the problem had just reappeared.... they were sending someone across the street to complain to the club...not clear if they were calling police, Not quite clear how many other people if any had called to complain this particular night, It was as loud as if we were on the street right outside the club--but keep in mind that not only were we on a high floor, we had our windows closed, and the air conditioning was on.   I suppose that on a week night for business travelers the Marriott Ceity Center is still a viable option, but I don\\'t know the club habits of Charlotte--perhaps even on a week night there might be an issue. Unless I were to be told with certainty that the club noise was no longer an issue I would not stay at this Marriott again despite its excellent location.

We booked rooms for a short two night stay but then decided to spend our second night in Napa. The hotel desk staff graciously canceled our second night without penalty. We reserved two rooms, an interior queen and a deluxe room. The queen, as expected, was very small although the decor made up for the size. The deluxe room had a 'view' but unfortunately our window looked into the scaffolding of the building across the street. When you stay there, request a higher floor (-rd or higher) facing the water. Also, the Argonaut offers a lot of 'package' deals. If you are driving a car, check out the deals that come with parking. The hotel charges $-- a night for parking (I parked on the street to save the charge and the bellman still walked over to my car and helped me with my bags. Gotta love this hotel). A rate that includes parking is often a better option than a regular room rate (the packages also include breakfast etc). Fisherman's Wharf is one big tourist trap so the area is deserted at night.. but you can get to other neighborhoods quickly. Avoid eating in the area.. food is not great and charges are high. Snag a cab or the cable car to another neighborhood and get a great meal for a lot less. During the day, its an interesting area to walk around.. and again, you can grab a cable car and visit other neighborhoods.   I am a big fan of the Kimpton hotels and this ia a great one. The decor makes it a lot of fun. I'd recommend it and I'll plan to stay there again in the future.\",\n",

They did automatically offer and accommodate a late checkout, a positive that seems to have become a trend with the chain for loyalty club members. The lobby was generally very busy and loud but not laid out or furnished in a manner to encourage people-watching. The hotel location is great if attending a convention and still pretty good for any other downtown or riverwalk activities with a few blocks of walking. The staff of the main restaurant were too flustered to acknowledge my presence at the time I tried to visit so I gave up and thus can't review the food.   My room on the --th floor had a nice view but the furniture was a bit worn and about average for a business hotel and below average for a Hyatt though the style fit the Hyatt brand.

One mattress sagged significantly but the two doubles proved helpful when I switched to the other bed for dramatically improved comfort.   In the end, the Grand paled in comparison to the other Hyatt downtown, other Hyatts I've stayed at and other competitors in town despite a price tag that seems to be higher.

The next morning my husband complained about the noise and the receptionist said she could move us to another room. We moved to the other room in the morning and then went out as we had travel plans for that day. Upon returning to the room we could hear noise once again - can you believe it we had been put over what I can only imagine was the air conditioning generator or similar, there was a constant noise all night long....how glad were we that we did not have to spend another night here.  Whilst the hotel was clean and tidy and the rooms were adequate we felt very upset that we had been treated so badly. After complaining about the noise on the first night we thought that the staff would have tried at least to give us a room with no noise or even an upgrade but no they did the complete opposite and put us back in the same position.  I would not recommend this hotel for the above reasons and whilst the location to Fishermans Wharf is handy a good nights sleep is more preferable I am sure to anyone. I would love to hear the managements comments as to why they thought it was acceptable to treat us this way. Do not book if you want sleep!',\n",

It was fine and met all of my expectations - the staff were friendly and very welcoming; the room was clean and comfy; the bed was very comfortable and the air was breathable; and the location was just what I needed.  It is a slightly out of the way corner and if you're new to NY you might be a bit spooked by the environment in the nearby block or two, since there are wholesale flower warehouses, downmarket shops and at the moment there is lots of construction going on. In fact, it's not at all a seedy or 'low rent' neighbourhood and when you walk half a block over to -th or -th avenue you feel part of the city again - don't be put off!  I didn't try any of the food except for breakfast on the first day, which was pretty much as you'd expect, and politely served.

However, it was late at night, my family was tired (my - and - year old daughters were already asleep), and we just wanted to get to bed. In any event, it shouldn\\'t take a phone call from me to change our room. We should have been issued a non-smoking room in the first place since it was stated on our reservation confirmation. We didn\\'t plan on spending a good deal of time in the room anyway.

Her advice to take the train instead of the bus saved us a little bit of time. They offered multiple newspapers (Herald, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, etc).

The hotel uses T Mobile for internet access and it took two days dealing with T Mobile to solve this problem (and two months after returning home to cancel the continuing debits). The hotel staff were no help - they continued to transfer me to the same TMobile number.

It's not enough to worry about. Just a couple of seedy shops. Reception had free coffee in the mornings and warm apple in the afternoon. This was an added extra because you could just grab a takeaway coffee-apple and head to your destination. The hotel was apporx --- mins from Times Square. Not far at all.

However, they put us up in the nearby, fancy Ritz-Carlton (a far superior but boring luxury hotel), even giving us cab fare to and from the Ritz. Why did this happen? 'A group came in,' the unsmiling young clerk said, as though bracing for a tirade.   Thinking maybe it was a group of groupies for some band playing at the HOB next door, we didn't protest much. I suspected it also had to do with the fact that we booked through Expedia, but can't substantiate that. Expedia was great. After paying in advance and having Expedia alert the hotel in writing that we were arriving late and us calling the hotel directly that afternoon from the east coast to confirm ('yes, we have your reservation'), it sucked coming from the airport and being summarily told there was no room. But points to the HOB for putting us up at the Ritz-Carlton (which failed to give us the requested roll-away cot when they didn't have a room with two beds for two straight guys so one of us slept on the floor on a bedspread at the Ritz after coming in at - a.m. but that's another story). Anyway, next morning, we called the HOB to tell them we were coming over for our room. 'Yes, sir, we have three rooms with twin beds.' Only problem was, -- minutes later, the front desk tried to tell us there were no such rooms. Persistence paid off, and we soon found ourselves in a nice, spacious room on the --th floor. Everything else about the HOB hotel was good. In fact, they wanted to comp us with a Junior Suite after the trouble we were put through, but it didn't have two beds. Points for HOB Hotel. We liked the room decorations and colors, although the voodoo motif might have scared the heck out of kids or a sleepwalker. The room had a great view and floor-to-ceiling windows that actually opened! Excellent air-conditioning. The bathroom was outstanding, as was the maid service. Night-owls will like the opague curtains. The towels were thin, but the shower fine. Doors were solid and elevators efficient.   The place seemed new and was very clean. No hookers seemed to be hanging around, although there was plentiful scenery in this chic location. The TV reception was poor and number of cable channels small.   But we didn't go to watch TV so didn't matter. They give you a compiliation blues CD. Rooms have a good little stereo system, so bring your own CDs. The room was spacious, with a desk chair, but no lounge chairs. Nice hassock, though. The downstairs bar, which just won a Chicago magazine poll for best hotel bar, was dead as a doornail Sunday-Monday-Tuesday. But the adjacent House of Blues restaurant-concert hall was hopping. The HOB location is great, just over the Chicago River from the Loop subway stops, meaning you can take a subway from either O'Hare or Midway and walk to the hotel if you're traveling pretty lightly. The river itself is dwarfed by majestic architecture and topped by multiple picturesque bridges, a few blocks away from the site of the ---- Eastland ship disaster that killed --- people (plaque marks the site for history buffs). Besides a friendly Smith & Wollensky next door overlooking the river, the general area is kind of beautiful but kind of dead, so hop on the Red Line to Wrigleyville or just about anywhere in the city (we got a three-day $-- subway-bus pass that we wore out). Back to the hotel--the lobby looks like something out of Marrakesh; this is not your average expensive hotel, perhaps an acquired taste, but I would definitely stay there again.

When I checked in I was asked two times by the staff if I REALLY needed the ADA room.(I thought that was just rude) Then they put me on the --th floor, which was fine. The room appeared to be fine. That is until I noticed the blinds did not work. I called down and they set someone up, they said they couldn't fix them because they did not have the part (aka I am out of luck, so sorry) Then I notice my bulb was out in the bathroom, and my floor lamp wouldn't work(the main light) They replaced the bulb. Told me they could not replace the lamp till the next day((aka I am out of luck, so sorry) Then when they came a -rd light went out while they were there, again they replaced it. So basically they do not check their rooms at all before giving out keys. Then I had a Traders Joe's bag full of paper goods , food and above all religious items. It was under the desk. We called at -:-- to have the room cleaned . We left and came back the bag was gone. We called down and told they would look for it. They did not find it. (big surprise there) Then my friend was told the maid said she did not take anything(so calling us liers ) If I were to lie, I say my laptop was stolen. I do not think she stole it , she was just careless and tossed it like trash(I have had the same bag in numerous hotels) Anyhow my friend was said there sorry next time your here we will upgrade you and have a nice day. No compensation at all. Well not the worse hotel, but could use some PR skills.\",\n",

The hotel welcomes guests with a pretty grass canopy-covered entrance that ushers you away from the street and inside a chic lobby. Vivian at the front desk was very friendly and gave us a complimentary upgrade! Our room was small by most hotel standards, but to be expected as it is Manhattan. Still, we had a large and comfy king size bed, ---in flat screen tv, and our own iPad with free internet access.

       " 'After staying there I now agree with other reviewers that this is a good hotel if you are only going to be in town for a few days I was there for a week and that was too long. I purchased a club level room, which is on the --st or --nd floor of the tower buliding and you get a lot of perks with that as well.   When I arrived I had to wait over - hours for my room becuase the person that was staying in my assigned room had not bothered to check out yet. They offered me a room on a lower level but I would still get the club benefits but I decided to wait for the room I paid for not some lower level replacement. The staff also told me that a different club level room was available and that it would be -- minutes so that the staff could clean it so I took this option. An hour later I approached the desk for the third time and was given room keys and sent on my way.   The club room on the --nd floor is nice but is not all that exciting to be honest, it has great views and has complimentary snacks and drinks as well as breakfast and dinner snacks but not enough nor quality enough to warrant what I paid to stay there.  About the thrid day into my vacation I decided to go and see what the breakfast in the club room had and arrived in time to see dirty plates everywhere and to find out that I was too late. After inquiring more information from the staff member that was up there I learned that upon check in I should have been given a welcome letter explaing all of this and vouchers for the restaraunt in the lobby as well. I went down to the front desk and explained my grief about not being informed. I was then given the welcome letter and some vouchers I was technically owed so all in all they did not really give me anything extra. Also I leanred from the club room staff memeber that the room would be closed for the next week which I was NOT AT ALL INFORMED ABOUT! This was truly upsetting.   So for my trip that I paid for I got:  average staff members  below acceptable customer service  the rooms were good only becuase of the view (the rooms also had extremely firm mattresses that I was unable to sleep on and NO FRIDGE) I had to go and buy a cooler so my leftovers would not go to waste!!!  Overall I spent too much money on services and options that I did not get to use and did not get any kind of compensation for my extra expenses.   The hotel overall is nice but they have a long way to go before I will ever conider staying there again!!!',\n",

My room was also not cleaned on my second day because I was in my room the two consecutive times the cleaning lady knocked. I told her to come back in an hour. She didn't. But they were very nice aout bringing the beauty products that weren't restocked as a result of the room not being cleaned up to me very quickly.

If I were to go again I would get a place closer to Tempe where there was actual life on the streets. If you do decide to stay at this hotel make sure to go to the Chinese Cultural Centre enarby to eat and check out the amazing grocery store.  The only significant shortcoming of the hotel was it's pool. I expected something nice and large but instead it was a small pool surrrounded by iron gating in the front of the hotel so you were kind of on display to the people parking and checking in.

The room also had a thermostat which would seemed to be non-functional...Me and my fiance froze our butts off even after raising the temp to its highest level.

The room itself was as typical and standard as a Hampton, will all the expected amenities. The rate was about what we expected, so can't complain there. The breakfast in my opinion was a step above the typical breakfast. We had omelets and waffles and turkey sausage, fruits, muffins, bagels etc. The breakfast hostess was very helpful answering questions about the area. The housekeepers came out and greeted all of us before they started work. You could tell they were having fun and enjoying their job. We left with a smile on our face, and if we are back in Memphis, we'll stay here again.

Bedding and LCD TV added to the comfortable surroundings. Who cares if one gets a beautiful view of the adjoining parking structure? Any woman, that's who! For guys, forget about it!

I did a lot of research before our trip (even emailing someone whose review I read here) and was amazed to find that all of the positive reviews were both true and well deserved. From the moment we first walked through the door, the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We arrived very early, so our luggage was safely stored while we explored NY. When we returned, our luggage was waiting for us in the room. The location is wonderful. Though we did a lot of walking to experience the many varied neighborhoods, subways to everywhere were a block or two away. The immediate surroundings offer a variety of excellent dining options( listen to the Chelsea Pines staff recommendations! They are great!) and I felt safe walking on the surrounding streets both day and night. Breakfast is varied, fresh, and delicious.

We also had a housekeeper ask us for our room number - times In row so she could clean our room. I explained to her we just got here and our room was fine. She insisted we give her the room number. I felt that was so very weird and creepy. I notified front desk, they didn't seem like they cared. This was not a cozy feeling hotel either. Cheap rates, I guess you get what you pay for.

This looks like a pretty new Westin and in my opinion looks like the nicest hotel in downtown Memphis - not counting the historic Peabody of course.   One thing that drives me crazy is how much you have to park at hotels. They charge $-- - day to park in their garage. I used points, but this isn't a cheap hotel, and it seems like the more you spend for a room at some places, the more they keep getting you everywhere else!   I also am disappointed that they charge so much for breakfast. I never can understand that you can spend $-- at a Holiday Inn Express - Hampton Inn, but you still get a free breakfast. When you stay at a hotel like this- you pay $--- - night and then they want you to pay $-- for a breakfast the next morning.  The room we had was really nice. No complaints. Very spacious, with a comfortable bed, big bathroom, nice amenities and cool view overlooking the FedEx Forum and Gibson Guitar Factory. Great location -- Beale Street is just around the corner. Great place if you plan on spending a lot of time in downtown Memphis - within walking distance.   A couple service issues - concierge was not very knowledgable in terms of restaurant recommendations. Also, I went down there to ask for some more coffee for our room, since all they had was decaf, and there was no one at the front desk for about -- minutes. I found this mind boggling. Literally no one anywhere. There was also an elevator out which made the wait for the other one pretty long.

The hall ways are scary and you think a ghostly little girl will pop out at anytime. I got to my room and it did smell like smoke but I was ok with that seeing as I am a smoker.

       " \"Just got back from a week at the Murray Hill Inn. We chose this hotel from the reviews on trip advisor, as they all said pretty much the same thing: a good, bargain hotel in a good location.  We'd read that the hotel doesn't have an elevator so we came prepared with a backpack rather than the suitcase and we'd suggest others do the same. The room was a bit small, but hey, from what I hear that's the norm for Manhattan. Importantly though it was clean. We'd also read from the hundreds of other reviews we'd scoured that bed bugs are a big problem in Manhattan (it was actually on the news while we were there!), but we were fine. I did a suspicious check on the night we arrived and there were none to be seen.  The bathroom was excellent - it was very clean. The shower had excellent pressure and stayed at a constant temperature; it was by far one of the best showers we've ever encountered in our hotel travels. The towels were white and fluffy, if a little small.  The noise from outside was no problem. We were expecting it to be very loud but it wasn't at all. The only thing we noticed was the heating system clanked and wheezed a bit - it didn't trouble us but it might annoy others.  The reception staff were very helpful and friendly - we arrived at the hotel very late on the first night (at about midnight) but it was no problem. They also helped us on the last day when there was an error with our airport transfer - thanks again for that!  Finally, another of the hotel's advantages is the location. It's just around the corner from the Empire State Building and Macy's and the --th street subway is only - blocks down for when you want to go elsewhere. We would also recommend the Brasil Coffee House on the corner of --th and Lexington (a few doors down) for morning coffee-tea with a smile.  Overall - a basic hotel, but for a good price. Clean rooms, helpful staff and good location.\",\n",

The breakfast was very skimpy, a few cereals and breads and pastries. No fresh fruit or yogurt , but what really bothered me was the pitcher they kept refilling with milk looked like it had not been cleaned in weeks and the lady working at the desk was not at all friendly. The plus side of this budget motel is the fact that it is right across the street from Avis Car Rental and a few blocks from Budget, which happens to be across the street from the Marriott Renaissance. We had rented from Budget and so after breakfast we just walked ( about - minutes) to the Budget lot, rented our car and drove back to the Super - and check out and were on our way!

During the daily meetings the conference room was beautiful stocked with teas, coffee, water, candies and never did anything go empty.

Located on Market street, a main road through downtown, this hotel is a very old hotel but has wonderful charm.   REMEMBER THAT THIS IS PART OF THE LUXURY COLLECTION HOTELS!!  Valet parking is VERY expensive, $-- +tax a day with in and out privledges but we never needed our car. There is NO self parking. The valet guys and the doormen were more that willing to help you with any directions that you need.

To pick up the car you cross Market Street to the depot. Cost is $-.-- a person and the ticket you get is usually good for - or so hours so be sure to hold onto it. The only problem with this mode of transportation is that once you get down to the Warf it is really difficult to get back. We waited over -- minutes for a car to come and finally decided to walk back. It\\'s about a - hour walk but very, very enjoyable, just be sure to get a map form the hotel before you venture out.   There are alot of bums in the area which was a little wierd but I guess that you get that is a big city. They really weren\\'t a problem.  There is a lot just in the hotel area to keep you busy. The genuine cable cars run in the area which was really fun to see. Union Square is a must. Like I said before, be sure to get a street map at the hotel it will REALLY help people that have never been to the area before.   Now to the hotel itself. Very nice but.........the sheets are AWFUL!! They felt like paper and the bed was old and VERY uncomfortable. When you are staying in a -+ star hotel and may be paying alot of money then why can\\'t EVERYTHING be top of the line?? We are Starwood Gold members and so we were hoping for some sort of an upgrade. When we checked in we went to the preferred check in area and were told that we were given a superior king room. Cool right??? Well, wrong. When we entered the room it was a little small, understandable as to the location of this hotel and space is at a premium in the city. The room and bathroom were nice but cramped. When we looked out the window all that we could see was a part of the hotel. Brick wall with windows of other rooms. We thought if this is what gold and a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"superior\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" room (To get gold status you have to either spend $--,--- or spend -- nights in any SPG property in a years time. Not that easy.) then we wonder what a normal not updated room was like. Don\\'t get me wrong, the room was nice, it had its small problems but it was still nice.   Room service which we didn\\'t use seemed VERY expensive by looking at the menu. We visited the bar, Maxfield\\'s to have a couple of drinks. We sat at the bar and waited several minutes to get waited on. We finally ordered and they also gave us a bowl of \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"snack\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" type chips.

OMG!!! We talked to a rude manager and he said that he would take care of it. So BEWARE of Maxfield\\'s and the drinks were VERY expensive around $---- for liquor and $--- a beer. That was the only experience we had with dining. We did notice that the buffet in the morning was around $----- a person. We went to the Starbucks and the McDonalds down the street instead. There is also a Del Taco, Subway, Westfield shopping center and several other stores and restaurants in the area. Also if you are down at the Warf go to Chippino restaurant and eat. VERY GOOD!!   Just remember that you are smack dab in downtown and this is a great location. Just beware that if you are spending a lot of money that it\\'s not always what you think it is. You also have to remember that you basically need to add $-- a day +TAX to the room for parking. We don\\'t think that we would stay here again as I\\'m sure that there are other hotels in the area that may be just as good if not better that we would investigate first. Don\\'t be fooled by the name or the look. It was a great experience but not really worth it.

In the entire week we were there, no one opened the door for us - no one greeted us. Shame on these new owners. Don\\'t they know the first thing about customer service? First impressions? Evidently not.  The first room they gave us had a terrible stagnant water smell coming from the bathroom drains. It was horrible and kept us up at night. Furthermore, the carpet had not been vacuumed and the bathroom floor and mirrors were not clean. We had to call housekeeping three times. Each time they would come, they didn\\'t correct the problems! We gave up.

We made our reservations for this trip in July!! We\\'re Hilton Honors members - who cares!

We made reservations there for dinner several weeks prior. I must say, the retaurant is terrible!! The whole layout stinks! The ceilings are far too low, the tables are bare, no table cloths, no flowers, no candles. Stark. The flow of the restaurant is tangled at best. No one knows which way to go while making their way to the buffet, which is situated at the far end of the long and narrow restaurant. It\\'s a zig-zig game getting to and from. Not only that, but we ate there for breakfast each morning (simply because our rate included it) and the congestion at the buffet and lack of service was miserable. There are plenty of waiters hanging about, but I don\\'t think the manager has told them what to do yet!! No salt and pepper shakers and silverware one morning. No coffee the next morning. Funny enough, we spoke to the manager of the restaurant and he admitted to us that the restauarnt had been designed by people who had no restaurant planning experience!! No kidding. I\\'d avoid this place. To think the hotel closed the wonderful French Quarter Restaurant and opened this??!! Unforgivable!! One more thing about this restaurant. The weird music choice. Who wants to hear Janice Joplin while eating Thanksgiving Dinner - or any other time for that matter!! The music was awful. Rap, New Age, Rock, ect. The manager said they were playing the staff\\'s CD\\'s. Wwhhhhaaat???   For a good restaurant, try Petterino\\'s, The South Water Kitchen (WONDERFUL!!) and Harry Caray\\'s. There\\'s also a Corner Bakery that serves good coffee, sandwiches and pastries.  Lastly, the decor is no longer tasteful. The lobby looks awful with a bar sticking out in the middle and massive yellow chairs obstructing the once lovely view. There are people guzzling drinks and half eaten plates of food cluttering up tables - in the lobby!! Dreadful. No relaxation there at all anymore. You cannot even walk through it. It\\'s a circus. The carpet choice on the floors we were on -- and then -- is hideous!

Chicago is sinking fast. We sure hate to see it go..... What\\'s next, are they going to raze Wrigley Field now? They seem to be the last man standing. Good-bye Chicago.  We did decide on one thing. No more Hilton Hotels for us. Even though Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House, their name is still attached. We\\'re sticking with Marriott, who is fabulous.

You idiot, you just moved to the fourth floor but you had better pray that your neighbors are quiet and go to bed at a reasonable hour, or that you have the same taste in music. If like me, however, they decided to crank up the techno music and bring the party to their room, count yourself in as their plus one and hang on for a ride into the middle of the night listening to your walls shake as they yell to be heard.   I should note: I called the front desk and they sent security, this didn't really do much. The biggest issue is honestly the paper thin walls. It is kind of unreal how much you can hear, every word (so if you plan on having sex or private conversations, take note it will be a community experience for your neighbors).

A couple of drawbacks were the fact that the heating system hasn't been upgraded with the rest of the hotel (yet) and was quite loud. Parking is less than ideal, but really no different than the rest of the city.   Depending on your preferences, the renovation is either a bonus or a letdown.

The couple of small issues were a lack of drawer space. Travelling with - kids, we really like to unpack and feel organized and there simply was very little drawer space to do this, so we lived out of suit cases. There was plenty of room in the suite for a dresser, but it simply wasn't there. Also, the bathrooms were somewhat lacking for a high end hotel. There is not a lot of counter space and not a seperate room for the toliet. Also, the walls are very thin and I woke up both mornings becasue of people talking outside of my room-it seemed like they were right in our room with us.  Overall, it is a very nice hotel-however, be expecting big and crowded. We had just come from a four seasons in jackson hole, so it took some getting used to.  We were trapped on the runway at the airport because of a bomb threat at the airport. We finally got to the hotel after a long day of travel and the front desk told us that the restaurant at the pool-water park closed at - (it was about -:--)   We rushed to the pools so the kids could go on the water slides and we could order food-unfortunately, the food service ended at -...so we were out of luck--we were starving and now wet...so we walked to the sports bar-where they told us it would be -- min wait for a table (even though there were a lot of tables open...) so I grabbed the manager, Chelsea, told her our story and she was very helpful and we were seated within minutes. I really appreciated her kindness and attention. Thank you Chelsea for really coming to our rescue! The food was good, service a little slow, but decent.  Prior to our stay-I had called the concierge and asked for recommendations on how to plan our few days at the hotel. She recommended staying on site on saturday because of all the kids activities and heading to Seaworld on Friday.  When we were at the pool on thursday-we asked about booking a cabana for saturday, only to find out they were all booked. This was very frustrating to me for a few reasons-first, in my opinion, if you call and ask for the concierge's advice and they suggest staying on site for a saturday-they should mention the cabana rental. The place was an absolute zoo on saturday. By --am, there were absolutely no chairs left--NONE! line of at least --- guests waiting to get their wrist band to get into the water park. secondly, we were staying in the highest room category on site. At most high end hotels, the guests staying in the highest end rooms are at least offered the ammenties such as a cabana (not for free, just the ability to rent one)...  Thankfully, the concierge manager Donna was wonderful and was able to reserve an end-cap cabana for us and it saved our last day on our vacation. Without that, between the crowds and the heat, it literally would have been miserable. Thank you Donna for your help and understanding.  Honestly, I felt like I was given bad advice by the concierge. The hotel is way over-crowded on the weekend. It is unmanageable and unpleasant. I wish we had gone to seaworld on saturday and stayed at the hotel on fri.  In general, this is a nice, clean hotel. It is just too big for my taste. The crowds were like a vegas hotel. The service was just ok because of the size. We ordered room service every morning and every morning, something was not right.  The water park is great, my kids love waterparks and the slides are big and fun.   If I were to go back to this hotel, it would certainly not be on a weekend. I wouldn't even consider going on a weekend. Maybe it was because it was the summer...but just crazy.  Also, every time we called the front desk for something, we were on hold for a few minutes.  In short, nice grounds, pretty hotel, clean and big rooms-new, service couldn't keep up with the crowds.  Chelsea and Donna were life savers. They were a highlight of great service during a stay full of very mediocre service.  Lacking the service for a -+ star hotel....but then again, I had just checked out of a Four Seasons, so it had a lot to live up to.

       " \"The property itself is clean, well-presented and well-maintained. However, for an airport hotel, and a property which does a great deal  of it's business with flight crews, it certainly does not go out of it's way to ensure that the crews are indulged.   We are Marriott Rewards customers (albeit the basic level), and were assigned a room on the ground floor - with a very narrow door, making  it hard to push our luggage through. This was almost laughable since the rooms on the opposite side of the hall had standard sized doors.   As other reviewers have noted, internet access is charged at $--.-- plus tax per day ... and parking is $--! So, a relatively inexpensive  room rate is pushed up substantially by the add-ons. So, if you have no car, and no need to use the internet - then this hotel is a relative bargain; if you need those accoutrement then the price rises  rapidly - and I would recommend the Doubletree down off of Sepulveda.  The other matter I took issue with during my stay was the large gathering that was held the morning of our departure. Since we were on the ground floor, and since there was an entry-exit at the end of our hall, it became very noisy in the morning as the group filed in, and furthermore, many members of that group were smokers so the hall was quite malodorous by the time we departed. Apparently, no effort was made to prevent the attendees from smoking in the lodging hallways.  On the bright side, corporate policy allows for a - PM departure upon  request - although that is done via the internet before one's arrival.  In summary, I would like to compliment the staff - to a person, they were pleasant and affable. To the management - rather than nickel-and-diming your flight crews, why not bundle everything so they will want to visit your property when traveling on leisure?   In all honesty, I probably would not return. More because I was disenchanted with the ground level room and the noise than for any other reason.

The toiletries were nice but not replaced on our second day.There were small hairs stuck to our bathroom door and wall which never got removed.

Dont pay for the cheapest room, its a -* hotel so naturally if you pay for the cheapest room it will be the smallest and have a poor view, so if you can afford to stay here, make sure you pay a bit extra. There are lots of categories of rooms and two wings to stay in so do a bit of research before booking. Dont not stay here because of the people who complain about the price of food etc, of course its expensive, its a -* hotel, but when in San Francisco why eat-drink away your money in the hotel? There are many great places a few mins walk out the door that offer just as good food for half the price. When I asked the concierge for recommendations on where to eat, he never mentioned their own restaurants which goes to show they do care about your experience in the city as a whole, not just how much you spend at the hotel. There are a lot of reviews that complain about how busy it is, that is never a bad thing.

The hotel was just perfect to come back to after a full day of walking, sightseeing and shopping. The room was cleaned everyday and fresh towels placed in the bathroom.   We also did the hop on hop off tour which we found to be a great help and got us to places we may not have seen otherwise!! It is worth $-- for the -- hour useage.

       " 'Marriott LAX - --.--.--   This is a typical large Marriott hotel with all the services you expect. It is very close to the airport terminals, but current arrangements with airport shuttles mean it may take longer to reach the hotel door than you would like. This, plus new LAX security policy, which apparently prohibits walking to and from the area, means that even though you are literally next to the airport, you should plan on more time to get to your room or meeting than you would have in the past.   Otherwise, we experienced no problems with this property.   As mentioned in other reviews, the rooms are alarmingly small for such a hotel, reminding one of some of the old New York City hotels that were converted from really old properties but kept the small room sizes. Given prices near the airport, it might pay to shop around for a hotel with more living space if you are going to spend more than a night there. Within a quarter mile of the terminals, there are lots of top hotels to choose from.   If you are not a frequent visitor to LAX, you should also prepare yourself for the airport’s abysmal conditions and expect it to take you maybe twice as long to negotiate outbound departures. Security procedures are closer to those in third world airports and the domestic and international terminal areas are well behind those in some other major USA airports and disorganized, despite the waves of TSA (read as “Thousands Standing Around”), personnel shuttling your checked baggage from one place to another. The absurdity of the three stage international departure exercise challenges both logic and patience as you must first check in with the airline, then physically carry your checked baggage to the TSA X-Ray point which is always backed up and understaffed, then go and get in line a third time for the usual mindless check of your carry-on and person. This routine may also include undue harassment from private security personnel at various locations.    Plan at least three hours for portal to portal, hotel front door to airline gate, to be safe.    Still, the hotel is convenient if you must be in or go through LAX and sometimes you have little choice. If you arrive there from overseas, prepare yourself for long waits, first at immigration and then at customs. Returning from Japan, we spent two hours after we got our luggage getting through US government check points. Private security personnel were the rudest encountered in many years anywhere, so again, prepare yourself for “The LAX Treatment.”    As other reviews show, there is no convenient place to eat except at other nearby hotels, so plan accordingly. Food and beverage inside the hotel was acceptable, but nothing outstanding or memorable.   Because of hotel chain loyalty, I would go back there again, assuming I got a competitive rate, but my future planning will try to avoid LAX altogether.',\n",

Room was not as nice as  it could have been-worn, uncomfortable bed, no reading lights at bed side, old, worn towels and windows sealed closed.  Room size was adequate and had the feeling of more space with very high ceiling. While the padded hangers in the closet , terry robe and free bottled water were a nice touch there was no in room coffee maker or turn down service offered.  As a classic historical, hotel it is quite incredible- the Garden Court atrium is a work of art.  A plus was free internet in the lobby also Bart to-from the airport is literally steps outside the hotel.

We had a very large room for a reasonable rate. A broken toilet handle was instantly fixed and everything else went very smooth. The location was great, many tourism attractions are within walking distance.  Having three kids, I have found it difficult to find hotel rooms that allow five people. The room we stayed in far exceeded our expectations. In addition to two bathrooms and two bedrooms it offered a living room with a kitchenette. This area was great for socializing in when others were ready to hit the sack. The next time I come to Chicago with my family, this is definitely where we're staying.\",\n",

The rooms were decent and the price we got it for was good (around ----night average). The drawback is the crowd of homeless folks across the street in Travis park, but they are not invasive at all.',\n",
       " \"I would recommend anyone thinking of staying in this hotel to reconsider immediately and stay at the nearby Hudson hotel instead.   Although we had booked a 'Superior Room', the room was tiny and most of the furniture fittings and wall coverings had seen better days. On the website the rooms looked spacious light and airy. In reality they were small gloomy and grubby. We had to lift our suitcases over the bed of the L shaped room as there was not room to wheel them past. After looking at the room we called the front desk to ask if alternatives were available. After - attempted calls when the phone went unanswered we finally got through and expressed our disappointment. We were offered a larger room on a higher floor, although we were warned that it did not 'have a view'. The current 'view from the room we were currently in was of the back of a building and a car park, so we decided to take the risk.  The next room we were given had more room only in that the bed was barely bigger than a single, the desk and chair had been removed and the TV was half the size of the previous room. There was not even room anywhere for the coffee machine which had been situated in the bathroom. There was no wardrobe, but there was a small single sized built in cupboard housing electrical and telephone switchgear with a small rail. Although we had booked a room with 'free' WiFi, it did not reach this room, and without a desk I would have been unable to do any work or use my laptop.  I attempted to contact the front desk once more and after another - calls which were unanswered again got through to the front desk. I explained that this room was in no way 'superior' and was in fact smaller and less well equipped than the previous room. I was told that no other rooms were available, but that if we wanted to move back to the first room we were offered I could do so. However I was advised that for an additional $--- we could upgrade to a suite the following day, when bookings were 'wide open'. By this time we were now running late for a dinner appointment, so we agreed to stay in the current room, on condition we could move to a suite the following day. We were told that if we packed our suitcases in the morning when we left the hotel staff would move them to a suite the following afternoon, and we could collect keys when we returned in the evening.  The following morning on leaving the hotel for the day, we handed back our keys asked for confirmation of the move to a suite. We were told in a very offhand manner that there was no possibility of such a move as the hotel was fully booked. The desk clerk disputed that we could have been told the above information about a room change. We then asked to speak to the duty manager who was quite frankly very rude, and was completely unconcerned that our weekend was being ruined. By this time staff had lied to me twice, about the move to the 'bigger' room the previous day, and about a suite being available today. I noticed the manager was smirking at my annoyance and I suggested that this was inappropriate and she laughed in my face. This suggested to me that this staff attitude permeates the hotel, and that no one has any genuine wish to look after their guests needs or satisfaction.  As a frequent business and leisure traveler I have never before experienced such a terrible product, or staff who give the impression that they are completely unconcerned about customer care and satisfaction. I the attitude of the (female) duty manager on the morning of Saturday - June was completely unacceptable for someone in the service and hospitality industry and I cannot understand how on earth she was ever given a position of responsibility.    Luckily we moved to the Hudson hotel, which for a similar room rate was in a totally different league, and the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. When we advised the manger that we were checking out early, she had the audacity to ask what was wrong, and indicated we would be charged for an additional night even though we had spent less that -- hrs in the hotel and were checking out at --am. It was only after further discussion when I indicated I would dispute the charge on my credit card that this was dropped.  The front desk staff and duty manager on Friday - June and particularly Sat - June are quite possibly the worst I have ever encountered.  I would suggest that as any prospective customers of On the Ave hotel choose the Hudson rather than this, dowdy and shabby establishment populated by rude and unpleasant staff.\",\n",

However, after very comfortable sleep Friday night we spent the entire day (- til midnight) discovering the city and returned to a room that had not been cleaned by housekeeping! Raised my concerns, naturally, and was reassured that something went askew with housekeeping. I know, this should NOT happen any where especially at an expensive hip boutique hotel. Management apologized and compensated with a full breakfast of choice in the building's trendy Breslin restaurant after I needed to ask that my husband be treated to breakfast as well.

I had friends up to the room and even w- - guys and - ladies everyone fit comfortably on the couch or in the closest window seat.   Service was wonderful, but I've come to expect that at a W.

       " \"Red Roof Inn Riverwalk is about a -- minute walk from the Riverwalk. The Riverwalk can't even be seen from the top floor of this hotel! However, if you are attending a conference and can't afford to stay in one of the conference hotels, this is the place to stay. The air conditioning works and was easily adjustable; although noisy it isn't as noisy as a cheap motel. Although it is right next to the freeway and I could see the traffic go by, the soundproofing stopped it from being a problem. The grab-and-go breakfast is adequate; bagels, muffins, juice, coffee, apples and oranges. Out of - breakfasts the coffee machine didn't work one day, the juice machine another day and there wasn't any fruit on another. The muffins were sugar soaked, sugar sprinkled, sugar overload but the bagels were healthier (toaster available) with a choice of spread, cream cheese and jelly (jam). The breakfast area was short on places to sit but it worked out reasonably well as business starts early (by -am) and tourists seemed to eat later. The food area was clean and I didn't see any flies.  The room was large, the bed was very comfortable with plenty of high quality pillows. The bathroom was clean and although they only provided bars of soap and hair shampoo, the soap had a very pleasant almond scent. There was plenty of clothes hanging space and an iron and ironing board. The hair drier was better than some hotel hair driers I've used. There was a safe. The room had two double beds, a dresser, with drawers and a small table with two chairs. The bedside alarm clock worked, the lightning was adequate. The coffee maker could not have been used to boil water for tea without it being coffee-tainted. The tv didn't have a lot of channels and the digital signal froze now-and-again but you could get news, weather, a film or cartoons for the children. The pool was on the side of the hotel next to the freeway flyover but it looked clean.   I chose not to have my room serviced and I was never disturbed by housekeeping.  The hotel does not have an airport or conference centre shuttle. If the -- minute walk is too much there is a regular bus ($-.-- per trip). The nearest stores are downtown and you have to go about a mile and a half to find a non-tourist supermarket. There are two 'Superdrug' type shops in the Riverwalk area but you have to go further for a pharmacy.  Walking in the opposite direction to downtown, San Antonio is very rundown.  If I had to work in San Antonio again I would stay at this hotel.\",\n",

I don't think we could have made a better choice. Upon check-in, the receptionist, Israel, told us we had an upgraded room, which was amazing, and was kind enough to provide a map and recommend some local places with great food. (Highlights were Thornton's for breakfast on a sunny morning and Trident Bookseller's & Cafe, where you must try the mushroom-fig sandwich.)  We knew we didn't need five-star luxury, just a place to sleep, but were pleasantly surprised by a hotel that is clean, relaxing, and has very comfortable beds. The yellow hallways give the hotel a happy vibe, and the bathrooms are done in white tile that didn't have me questioning the cleanliness. The hotel has free WiFi, unlike some other local hotels that charge you. We had breakfast in the cafeteria downstairs and were happy with the good price and convenience.  The hotel is about --- feet from Back Bay Station on the Orange line, which was very convenient for taking Amtrak in, and about a quarter mile from Copley on the Green line. This made getting back very easy, even with unpleasant winter weather. The hotel is very close to Newbury Street, Trinity Church, and the Boston Public Library and within easy walking distance of the Prudential Center, Museum of Fine Arts, and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, all of which I would recommend visiting. This meant we saved a lot of money by walking instead of taking the Subway.  Overall, I would absolutely stay in this hotel again if I find myself in Boston!\",\n",

When we checked in, I off-handedly mentioned that it was our tenth anniversary. Once we settled in to our room, guest services provided us with a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries! I was totally floored that hospitality like that still exists in a big city hotel. Everyone from the front desk staff to housekeeping did all the little things right.  Leigh Ann, the conscierge, really went out of her way to make out stay wonderful.

It was hardwood floors, so I think I noticed the dust around the corners a little more. The sheets were comfortable and so was the bed.

       " \"When I was there from August - to August -, the weather was beautiful.

The hotel is only - blocks from a subway station which only took me only ----- minutes subway trip from the airport, which was great for only $-.--.   There are locals that also pay to use the pool facilities, sometimes screaming and loud kids can conflict with paying locals and other guests. The lifeguard on duty is mostly attentive, but is also responsible for ensuring only guests and paying locals are using the pool.   The location is also convenient to walk to many different places and neighbourhoods, but with such a great air conditioned subway, there are multiple options to get around and see the sites.  The top two floors were finished with renovations; I guess they are working down. I liked my room even though it wasn't renovated. It had a king bed, chair, desk, tv, separate room for toilet and shower from the sink. Free Wi-Fi is always a great feature, which they had at this hotel. The -th floor rooms that face the pool have a shared balcony amongst all other -th floor rooms, this can be something to enjoyed or concerned if you don't mind people walking up and down the entire balcony.  Our group did have some challenges when we asked front desk for a limo for our group to the restaurant and a cube van was delivered. This was very disappointing for the person in our party that booked the limo.   The fitness room is very basic; the restaurant is nice and friendly. Not very busy so you can get a meal pretty quick.

The grounds and facilities are decent enough, check-in was pretty smooth and there were no major complaints. However, the hotel is a fair distance away from the interstate. Keep that in mind if you're staying for just a night or passing through. If you're staying for a few days and playing golf, the proximity of the interstate probably isn't a big deal. In addition to being a distance away from the interstate, the place was a little difficult to locate, its behind some small farms, etc., and not in a place where you'd expect to find a hotel.   Aside from the location, this place wasn't really anything special. The decor was a little dated and cheesy looking, and you can tell its a timeshare golf condo rather than a hotel room. We didn't use any of the kitchen facilities since we were just staying for a night. They were installing something in the room next to ours and there was some noise from drilling and hammering while we were staying there, which was fortunately not during hours when we were sleeping. Also our doorbell was randomly rang at - AM and no one was there when we got up and looked...since there isn't any real security and anyone can get on the grounds, we were a little suspcious of that.   All in all, not terrible for a night's stay, but nothing special. I think it would be more appealing if you were staying a few nights or using the facility for a golf vacation, since its not too close to the interstate.\",\n",

The lobby was nice, the front desk was friendly. However, the rooms reminded me of a renovated Crowne Plaza. The beds are comfortable, but I wasn’t impressed with the pillows.

We ordered room service one night and only one meal out of three was correct, when you are ordering a $-- grilled cheese, you expect perfection :-) The pool area was nice, but the hot tub didn’t have enough water and it took well over hours upon reporting to get filled, I don’t even know how long because we didn’t stay any longer. In short, I would recommend this hotel to a friend if it was the right price, but there are other hotels I would first recommend. The location is okay, but I have enjoyed other locations more too.

They knew how stressed my trip was and were so intuned to providing me the best service. I was by myself with my young son and needed to drive back and forth to the college. Not an easy feat!   The rooms were reasonably priced when you look at DC pricing, the room was spotless, and the bed was so comfortable. It was in a perfect spot in Georgetown near everything.

The lobby was fantastic staff very friendly, parking drive was a bit crazy and scary since everybody was driving in and out very fast and it was extremely crowded but that goes with staying in a downtown hotel. The bed was not their heavenly bed as we expected and expect from Westin. I suspect they either substituted a cheaper replacement or something because it was horrible. We were close to street and the noise was enough to drive you crazy, I don't know where it all came from but we heard kids and adults carrying on till the wee hours. The room A-C control is one of those fake controls, you can't change the temp and it wouldn't matter if you tried, you will get what they want you to have. So it's enough to survive, better than outside, but NOT comfortable.

It's noisy, expensive, and most are not maintained as well as they should be, parking is overpriced, you have to tip everyone for everything but if you want to stay on the Riverwalk it's part of it. I'd never pay their rack rates or call direct for reservations, knowing what I know I'd always do Priceline if you want to endure all that it takes to stay on the Riverwalk.

I realised that with a lot of luggage we might be cramped so I booked a queen-queen-sofa-bed (i.e. could sleep -).   As it turned out, it was above his expectations. True, we had no view but the widesceen TV in what must be one of their largest rooms made up for this. Free wi-fi access too although if you want to print boarding passes, save them to pdf and put them on a memory stick - for about - bucks you can get them printed out up the street. The beds were hard but this seems to be a trend these days. Aircon was extremely efficient. Cleanliness and daily service were good. Don't let the lack of restaurant put you off although I would recommend taking a bottle of water up at night. Under the hotel is a wonderful Soda Shop for breakfast and the fabulous Cosmo Cafe where we had coffee and cheesecake by candlelight one night. They also do romantic dinners. We highly recommend both establishments and there is a Starbucks too if you must.   The hotel is situated right next door to the Chambers St. subway entrance for lines -,-,-. Beware there are several entrances, depending on which line you travel. Print out your subway map before you go at [--]  It isn't very far from the former Twin Towers but we found this to be a site of optimistic regeneration.

Other tips for travellers to NY:  Downtown = South  Book tickets on the internet in advance for EVERYTHING to save some time queueing and beware long lines in peak periods. Pay attention to security requirements. Walk to Battery Park for the Liberty-Ellis Island cruise - this was our best value for money trip but book well in advance for a morning slot or your time at the Statue of Liberty will be limited (ours was slightly curtailed).\",\n",

On returning to the room found my wife cleaning the skirting boards of accumulated dust and grime. The bathroom was very tired with the shower producing nothing more than a dribble and the shower head had seen better days. Both the bath and basin has surface cracks and scratches which were stained. On turning on the air conditioning found that it drowned out any conversation and the sound from the tv. The windows in the room provided no sound proofing from the sounds of the street and therefore as New York never sleeps neither did we !!!  Unable to rest at all with the air conditioning switched on so room gradually became uncomfortable through the night.  Deadlock on the door also was faulty and did not work so security was a concern.  Overall wouldn't stay here again as there has to be better hotels in similar location.

       " 'I like the Hilton brand hotels and stay frequently. Booked the brand new HGI Inner Harbor for a weekend family getaway. I was delighted but disappointed all in the same trip. The pros - the hotel is brand new and the location is fabulous - close to all inner harbor attractions. Since the hotel is new, it is very very clean (spotless actually) and the rooms are modern and cozy. They are a little small, but I find that common with any big city hotel. But overall, I was satisified w- the accomodations. We had a room on the --th floor (top floor) with a nice view of the inner harbor. The odd # rooms face towards the harbor-city. The cons are that because the hotel was new, I think the staff was too. Service can use a Hilton make over. Check in was very slow. The clerk seemed genuinely unwelcoming and uninterested that I chose his hotel to stay in. He provided no information and barely made eye contact. The hotel is co-located w- the Homewood Suites by Hilton so be careful to go to the correct desk & elevators. Homewood clerks had no action but stood at their stations staring at - of us in line to check in to the HGI without offering any of us assistance. When I got to my room the card keys didn\\'t work and my wife had to keep my three small children out in the hall while I went back down to rectify the problem. I barely got an apology and was told I probably put them next to my cell phone (meanwhile my cell was in my bag on the baggage cart so it was impossible for that to have happened). I told the guy that wasn\\'t the case and he just handed me my keys and said \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"here you go.\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" Not Hilton-esque service! After we got settled, we attempted to order room service but the book in the room didn\\'t have a menu. We called to ask for one and I actually had to go down to the restaurant to go get one (that\\'s what the staff suggested when I called). They said they hadn\\'t gotten the in-room menus yet. No offer to bring one up to us.  To access the pool, you need a separate pass to the health club (non Hilton facility in the same building, but guests can get in with a pass and photo ID ). Ask at check in b-c they don\\'t tell you about it when you do check in. Also, you should inquire about parking so you can get an in-out access card - again you aren\\'t told by the staff, you have to ask for everyting. It\\'s $-- but that is actually a bargain for the area especially with in-out priveleges. Main attractions are in walking distance anyway.  Ate breakfast at the Great American grill. Food was good but very slow at the counter - they cook to order eggs, pancakes, etc.. There was a wedding party so that may have contributed. Restaturant staff was friendly and helpful, but again, you could tell the hotel was new in operation and all parts weren\\'t moving in the same directions quite yet. We walked by the General Manager\\'s office on the way out and he looked up with a mean grimmace. Not even a good morning or anything. Not so friendly like I\\'m used to at other Hiltons.  Overall, I was pleased with the room, the cleanliness, and the location. The level of service needs to be improved for me to consider it of Hilton quality. I would call my stay an \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"Ok\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" experience and I would consider it again after the staff was properly trained and had some experience under there belt.',\n",

The hotel manager was apologetic, and quickly booked our room for the original quoted rate and sent me an email confirmation.  The night we checked in, the GPS eventually got us to the hotel, but using the GPS we had to drive through a residential subdivision. Ordinarily, this would not be a big deal, but this particular neighborhood has the largest speed bumps running across the road that I have ever seen. Seriously, who needs speed bumps nearly a foot high? Who needs speed bumps a foot high every -- feet for a quarter of a mile? After slowly dragging the underside of our car over the third or fourth speed bump, and gritting our teeth to the sound of metal and plastic grinding against these asphalt speed humps from hell, I decided to turn back and find an alternate route. The GPS found one- by going only one block further, and it took us directly to the hotel parking lot- without any speed bumps...   We arrived at --:--pm (we had changed time zones on the drive), and the clerk quickly got us checked in. We were disappointed to learn however, that all of the nearby restaurants, bar and grill places, even the fast food joints, cater specifically to the nearby businesses and as a result, all of them, and I mean all of them, closed at - or --pm.

The kitchenette is open to the room and there is a small table separating the spaces. There is not enough room for a sofa, but there was a recliner parked in the corner. There was nothing in the room that wasn\\'t functional or appeared to be heavily used or dirty. The ac appeared to be newer, and worked fine. The room was very clean, but appeared somewhat dated. We did not use the appliances, except for the refrigerator and the coffee maker- both of which worked fine (the coffee was awful however-bring your own if you can). The bathroom was very clean and it had a full size tub with a shower. The water pressure was good, and there were no problems with temp fluctuations during bathing. Oddly, there was no shampoo in the shower, and when we noticed this the next morning we remembered that a guest came down while we were checking in to get shampoo. Maybe shampoo is provided upon request or something like ketchup at the McD\\'s drive thru?... The bed was very firm (I had no problem, but the wife didn\\'t sleep well because it was too firm for her). The pillows were the typical synthetic, non-allergic spun polyester type (which should make all of the asthmatics in your party giggle with glee) but if you use just one pillow, your head will sink to the mattress, (which I suppose could also be an issue for stomach sleepers...)  The next morning, We looked out the window to find the parking lot nearly completely empty, and commented on the fact that we never heard any sounds from outside of our room.

I explained my mistake to the front desk clerk who couldn't have been nicer. She cancelled my other reservation and gave me a room for a very good price. She even comped my parking and gave us breakfast for four for free. The room was very nice, and the service was excellent. The staff was very helpful.

       " \"Why I'm rating this hotel as one star is not that it truly deserves one star. It's to make up for all the people that mistakenly have given it such good reviews. The truth is that it's a two star motel with pretensions of being a three star motel but with some serious one star failings. My feeling is that at a three star motel you should feel safe and comfortable. The rooms were noisy. The second floor rooms shook as people walked by outside because of a walkway with a cantilevered design. The heating units were of an older type which means they were hard to control and noisy too boot. The beds were too high (sitting on the bed my feet did not touch the floor) and too soft. Now, as far as safety was concerned, I have some serious doubts about gas stoves in a motel. In addition the location of the motel was in a slightly dicey neighborhood.  Note, this motel is not very conveniently located if you are a tourist and there are also not all that many good places to eat nearby. The exception is the small Lebanese restaurant directly across the street which is quite authentic and worth a visit.\",\n",
       " 'There\\'s a lot of positive things about this place.   First is location -- it\\'s extremely convenient to the airport and most of the attractions as well. There is also a Trader Joes and Vons within less than a half mile -- almost walking distance. The location on the esplanade park and walkway is wonderful, with bayfront-estuary views and a huge walking-biking pathway right outside the door and a huge park there too. Its in a quiet safe neighborhood with the only sound disturbances being the planes taking off, because of the proximity to the airport.    The rooms have a nice almost full kitchen -- full size fridge, dishwasher, microwave, - burner range and no oven. There is a nice large granite type counter area that is very convenient for food preparation and a small dining table with - chairs in our one bedroom unit. There\\'s a nice little balcony with one chair on it -- for a little reading or coffee in the sunshine. There are two LG flatscreen TVs -- one in the living room and one in the bedroom that are quite adequate. The fold out couch in the living room is smallish and the cushions are showing some age related compression, but it was still comfortable. There\\'s a worktable with ergonomic chair and easy web access stuff and outlets that are efficient and comfortable. The bed linens are soft and comfortable, there are a wide variety of pillows available. The toilet paper is Cottonelle -- so it\\'s nice and soft, not the single ply sandpaper stuff that many places are trying to offer now, and the toiletries are very nice Neutrogena products.    The business center computers are antiquated and slow and pretty much only useful for printing out boarding passes. The laundry is large and bright with plenty of machines that are modern and do a good job. My husband enjoyed the exercise equipment that included a treadmill, elliptical, stationary bike, free weights and a weight machine - drinking fountains and a TV were available in the workout room.   The gardens and outdoor areas were extensive, well landscaped and maintained.. There was quite a variety of outdoor seating available, with many areas having gas fireplaces in the seating areas. There were several outdoor grills available for guest use that were modern, clean and ready to go.   The breakfast and dinner offerings are adequate - but not gourmet. You get hot filling food, but it\\'s just kind of average. Standard make your own waffles, bagels, english muffins, etc, - three \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"hot offerings\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" which usually are eggs, sausage and tater tots -- the best of which is the tater tots, and a fruit and yogurt bar that has canned peaches, canned mandarins, cottage cheese and yogurt, and some fresh melon chunks. Evening offerings are a nice enough salad bar, and a hot offering that has been during our stay - edible, but mostly because it\\'s included. There\\'s drinkable wine and beer and with the nice pool table and fireplace area, it offers a nice opportunity to unwind after the day.   I found the staff to be friendly and responsive, even when our flight was delayed. The cleaning staff is polite, unobtrusive and efficient.  The hotel offers very good rates, with nice discounts for government and AAA and they participate in the HH points program. It is a family oriented hotel, so there will be kids at breakfast, in the pool, etc.... and, of course, their behavior is up to their parents ... but we had no problem with noise.   Overall - the best place to stay in SanDiego if you\\'re not looking for night life, excitement etc. If you want a great convenient location, nice facilities, large room, kitchen facilities, and the open air experience -- with just a few minutes to the zoo, SeaWorld, Balboa park, airport and downtown -- no parking fees, no internet fees, and a safe place where you and your kids can stretch out and run around....

       " 'There is a sign posted by the door of the Wit that says something to the effect of \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"more an experience than a hotel\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\". After staying here for one night, while attending a wedding onsite, I\\'ll have to say I think management should focus more on being a hotel and less on being an experience.  The positive things about the hotel are evident from the website. The rooms are unique, the modern decoration is attractive, and the location is fantastic. I attended a wedding reception, which used the roof bar for cocktail hour, and the views are simply amazing. It\\'s a very hip, fun place to hang out.  But, I really can\\'t recommend spending your money to sleep here. To start, there was a parade going on downtown, and we could not navigate the streets to get to the hotel. We called the front desk to ask for directions, and for help on where to park since the parking entrance was blocked by the parade. The front desk literally knew nothing. Despite the fact that the parade was marching by their front door, no one had any information about the route, or timing, or how to park at the hotel during this time. We finally had a friend drop us about a half mile from the hotel, and we walked over to discuss in person how he could drive up. They acted just as clueless in person as they had on the phone. Friend ended up parking elsewhere and walking over.  Second, after the wedding reception ended, the bride invited the group to the rooftop bar to continue the party. What we were not told, by hotel management, is that after a certain hour only one elevator takes you to the roof, so we would have to go downstairs, go outside, wait in line, get a wrist band, then take the elevator back upstairs. Not realizing this, myself and a few others went in to the stairwell from the floor we were on for dinner to walk up to the roof. There was a bouncer at the door who would not let us in, which is annoying to begin with, but that alone wouldn\\'t make me complain. However what was simply unbelievable is that he would not escort us to the elevator to let us out, and instead left us LOCKED in the stairwell on the top floor! None of the doors on other floors opened, until the ground floor. And, I was wearing heels. He would not call anyone to come let us in, even after we begged and explained that we were hotel guests trying to get to our room, he simply told us we had to leave and walk all the way down. We started banging on the doors at each floor, and a hotel patron heard us and opened from the inside and let us in. Needless to say I did not bother trying to get back to the club.  Back in our room, which was on a middle floor, closer to the top than bottom, to add insult to inury we could hear the music from the club while we tried to sleep! My friend was on a floor above us and said it was so loud she couldn\\'t sleep at all. It wasn\\'t awful where I was, but definitely you could still hear it.  So, overall, this is a nice place to visit, but service is lacking, and for most people it\\'s not the best place to rest your head. Look elsewhere to spend your dollars.',\n",

We had an opportunity to eat at the Steak House, -- Oaks which is loctaed on the golf course and it was exceptional. It is somewhat pricey but worth every penny. They also have a large sports bar-restaurant with numerous beers on tap and decent bar food. Another on site restaurant is the Cibolo Moon which is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and we ate there on a few occassions and must say it was also very good. I also thought the prices were fair for the type of property the resort is.   The only draw back to staying at this property is that you need a car as there is nothing within walking distance so therefore yo have to drive. To take a cab into san Antonio too see the Riverwalk or the Alamo it is a SIXTY DOLLAR cab fare one way. The hotel does not have a shuttle and I do not think that they are planning on getting one as they want you to stay and spend your money at the resort. With that being said I would not hesitate to go back.  It is also of note that all the staff are great and go out of their way to make you feel very special.\",\n",

       " \"I've stayed in at least a dozen hotels in San Francisco within walking distance of the Palomar. Most cost a little less. For me, the slightly higher rate for the Palomar was worth it.   It's not a true luxury hotel, so don't go there expecting something extraordinary; if you're content with a basic, comfortable room, you can find many at a lower rate. But at the Palomar, my room was definitely larger than average. Although I don't spend a lot of time in my hotel rooms, over a period of several days a small room can feel cramped. The bed was fine, the decor was understated and classy. Everything was clean. Flat screen TV with DVD player, mp--player clock radio, mini bar, bathrobes and umbrella in the closet along with an iron, selection of good newspapers. The bathroom was average--nothing remarkable, but no problems with the shower or anything else (not always the case in my experience; sometimes showers are cramped, or the shower head is too low, or the water turns hot and cold by itself). I was on the seventh floor, and although the windows were covered by plate plexiglass, which dampened exterior noise from the busy street below, I could hear an occasional honk or dumpster routine in the middle of the night. But it was relatively quiet; I've been to many hotels in the area at which dumpsters being emptied in the middle of the night have made sleep impossible; not so here. It has a free wine hour in the evening.  The location--around the corner from Market Street--is a matter of personal preference. It's a short walk to Union Square, but there are many hotels a few blocks closer. I always use the BART, so I liked having the station a minute from the hotel, instead of ten minutes.  I was particularly impressed by the service. Each and every one of the people I dealt with at the front desk was extremely helpful as well as friendly. I got a good recommendation for a breakfast place nearby, and the staff person called to make sure it was serving before I walked over. I had a problem with my check at the hotel bar (under separate management) and the hotel took care of it without any hassle at all.

Every time the reception staff called a cab for me, it would not be a legally registered cab with taximeter. It was a guy with his personal car charging flat rates. My room itself was reasonable, the only problem was a mild cigarette odor in the carpet. What is really terrible, actually, is the bad neighborhood where the hotel is. One morning when I was there, five days ago, one of the guests had his car window broken and some of his stuff was stolen during the night.

Lots of mid-twenties guests this day.  We ate dinner at the restaurant. Food was alright, described better than it turned out to be. Bread was tasty and warmed as was the calamari. Vibe was very upscale, hipster diner-ish; though cheekily designed and low-light. Menu was different than what is online. Service was indifferent; pushy and hurried though only was at half capacity. I asked for two items from the lunch menu (I’m pregnant and had my heart set on the onion soup and onion-goat cheese tart!) and was told by the waiter, who didn't even bother to check with the chefs, that the request couldn’t be accommodated even though those items were available for dinner through room service. (Is this is a shared kitchen?) Waiter seemed to feel his only job was to deliver food not a decent experience.

We arrived Christmas Eve, the night before the blizzard and you would think that anyone working Christmas Eve would want to do anything but be at work, let alone during a blizzard. This couldn't be further from the truth at XV Beacon. The staff was amazingly attentive, friendly and helpful without being overbearing. During the night of the blizzard, the only restaurant open was the hotel's (Mooo) which happens to be an amazing steak place in its own right. The hotel's room service is also served by Mooo, so we decided to have a great steak in our room, snow and wind blowing outside in front of the fireplace in our room...what could be better. From the bell staff, front desk, concierge and cleaning staff...you simply don't find service like this in most hotels, let alone more expensive ones. We highly recommend XV Beacon to anyone wanting a great place in the heart of Boston.\",\n",

On a recent trip to Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, Mexico, we were traveling through DFW from Washington DC. Due to forecasted snow on our day of departure, American Airlines cancelled our outbound flight and they re-booked us so that we over-nighted, at our expense though, in Dallas in order to catch the one-day-a-week flight to Ixtapa.  You should note that there are two Hyatt hotels at DFW. In terminal C is the Hyatt Regency DFW and in terminal D is the Grand Hyatt. We decided to choose the Grand Hyatt given that our plane was due to leave from this very same terminal. To our surprise, the Grand Hyatt is a stunning hotel even superior to any city hotel in which we have stayed let along the reputation of “airport” hotels.  In the event that you arrive at any other terminal, there are regular (free) airport shuttles that will take you to the Grand Hyatt in terminal D. For starters, once one collects their bags in terminal D, it is a very easy walk and an escalator ride to the elevators to the Hyatt. What struck me as we approached the hotel elevators was that the American Airlines check-in (for our following day departure) could not have been more than -- steps away with the security area literally adjacent to it. Nothing like rolling out of bed and checking-in for your flight!  Exiting the hotel elevator, you will be presented with a well appointed lobby to your left and to your right a very attractive bar and restaurant. This hotel also offers conference facilities that are rather impressive. Our west facing room was a suite on the sixth floor that was spacious with a living room and very large bedroom. The décor is modern and minimalist with a very fancy lighting and (electric) blind-curtain system. The standard amenities are all included. Yet, a peculiarity was noted that we never experienced: you have to call the reception so that they can deliver a coffee maker-pot for the room. This is very odd. Although the rooms are well insulated and may be stating the obvious, you will hear some noise of the departing aircrafts even if they may not be using the runways in front of terminal D. Yet, traffic subsides significantly after --pm.   A quick tour of the property is worth it not just to familiarize oneself, but to appreciate the many amenities. Aside from the expansive conference facilities and business center, it has a very good fitness center, outdoor pool and sun deck. Features that I am sure would come in handy when staying during warmer months. The restaurant is very large and attractive. We have a very tasty breakfast the following morning.

Valet service was always courteous and helpful (giving directions, offering cold water, baggage assistance, holding doors, etc) - it was a pleasure to come back to the hotel and in and out privileges are included with valet.

No dust or crumbs around the baseboards. The mattress was high and firm. The sheets were white and the beds were decorated with accent pillows. The bathroom featured a separate shower and tub, complimentary toilettries and clean, white shower rugs. I also used the fitness center and was impressed with the number and condition of the cardio machines. Most hotels have one or two machines that are terribly outdated. The fitness center at the Omni was spacious and featured elliptical machines, treadmills with mini tvs, and some machine and free weights. The free weights were a little on the old side, but the overall fitness room was more than what I expected. Further, the Omni has a courtesy car that can take you to any business location in the city! I definitely recommend the Omni if service, cleanliness and amenities are of importance to you.\",\n",

       " 'Loved the hotel and its location! We\\'re a family of six, and picking a hotel is always a delicate balancing act. We need enough room where we don\\'t drive each other crazy but it also needs to be relatively affordable. The Affinia Dumont was perfect for our --night holiday stay in NYC. We had a --bedroom skyline suite with - queen beds in the bedroom and a pull-out sofa in the living room. Beautiful view of the city, including the Chrysler Building.   The suite had a roomy foyer-like area at its entry-way which was great for the keeping of our shoes and boots. There was also a really nice dresser - closet - dressing area in the bedroom area outside of the bathroom that was great for keeping our suitcases, dirty clothes, and collection of jackets out of our way.   The kitchen was set off in a little room by itself, which I really liked. It was very small but had everything you could need - full size refrigerator, toaster, microwave, decent-size sink, coffee maker, gas (!!) stovetop with oven, dishwasher, and lots of drawer and cupboard space. It was also stocked with silverware, plates, bowls, cups, glasses, a couple of pots, and a frying pan. There was service for four and we needed more; we requested more and they quickly stocked it with service for six for us.   The bathroom was surprisingly roomy and had plenty of shelf space for all our things - a typical one over the sink area and then another deep one on another wall. Water pressure in the shower was good, but like in a lot of hotels, the water fluctuated between very, very cool and very, very warm.  The staff were all particularly competent and friendly - from before our trip down right through the time we (sadly) had to leave. Check-in was quick and efficient, and the bellman (Donald, I believe) was super welcoming and helpful. The front desk manager David was very helpful in planning our stay, and housekeeping did a great job every day.  We fully utilized a number of the hotel\\'s offerings - kitchen (in its entirety!), the pillow menu, the bathrobes, the telescope (requested with the skyline suite), the DVD player (that was brought up within ~- minutes of our request!), the steam shower, the fitness room, the strengthening kit - and truly appreciated them. I booked the room through the Affinia website and had a lot of fun with their My Affinia - My Concierge.  The hotel has recently been renovated, and they did a terrific job. Everything was very nice and tastefully done. Both rooms had large flat-screen TVs. Beds were very comfortable, and down pillows were plentiful. We were on the --th floor and had no problems whatsoever with the elevators. We found them to be quite speedy - both in arrival time and travel time. Lobby is relatively small but inviting and seemingly comfortable - there were always people in it on their computers. We didn\\'t use it, so I can\\'t say how the internet service is.  The Murray Hill location is a joy. In the past, we\\'ve tended to stay in the Theater District, but I greatly preferred staying in Murray Hill. I like that it has more of a neighborhood feel but it\\'s still so convenient to anyplace you\\'d want to go. We easily walked all over - to and from Times Square and Broadway a couple of times, to Grand Central, back from the American Museum of Natural History, up to and through Central Park (all the way up to --th St). If you don\\'t like walking that much or the weather is bad, the closest subway station is just a little over a block away.   There are a lot of parking lots right around the hotel. The hotel offered to valet park for us for $-- - -- hours, but we didn\\'t mind finding parking on our own. The first one we tried (right across the street) was full, the second one we tried didn\\'t want to take our minivan, but the third one worked out (for $-- - -- hours - a great rate for the city). So be patient - there are enough around that you\\'ll get a spot.  While the Murray Hill deli on the corner is nice for grabbing one or two things, there\\'s a great grocery store (D\\'Agostino\\'s) right around the corner (-rd Ave and --th St). We also really enjoyed eating lunch at the close-by Banc Cafe on -rd Ave and --th St - very low-key and relaxing atmosphere, excellent food and service.

For those of you who want a quick summary, it's here at the top, the details are all below.  Summary:  ------------  Cons:  * beds were small, ac was noisy, rooms smell of vapor-rub  * avoid the pool and hot-tub Sunday evening through Wednesday night - it's a health hazard  * outdoor area has mosquitos, bring bug spray for evenings outdoors in the restaurant or at the pool area  * family budget: restaurant is typical san diego prices which are expensive for a family, eat elsewhere if possible if you're on a budget or utilize the restaurants happy hour for a good deal -- the food we did have was good tho.  * you cannot SAFELY walk to the beach from this hotel, even tho it's advertised as such  Pros:  * Rooms were clean, comfortable, and well appointed. Hotel was in a business neighborhood and we felt safe at the hotel.  * Shuttle service was prompt and helpful for trips to the beach  * Pool area was fun and well designed (but only use when the pool has been cleaned)  * well located for access to san-diego - seaworld, and legoland  The only reason we stayed here is because we got a --% off deal on the room, and it was close to the beach, and it looked like the pool area would be great for the kids, which turned out to be NOT the case because the pool was so dirty during most of our stay there. I would not stay here again at the same ($--- per night with) or full price.  Details:  ----------  -. The rooms are decent sized, beds are comfortable, it was clean. The 'queen' beds are actually doubles or very close to it -- much smaller 'queens' than in any other hotel we've stayed at. The kids were accidentally kicking and hitting each other at night, The room's a-c unit was very loud, not just the normal fan sound but a loud buzzing background noise as well -- if you are a light sleeper that needs to be cool I would suggest avoiding this hotel. The rooms smell like vapor rub -- other reviewers said that the rooms smelled, and maybe this is the hotels way of trying to freshen it up, it wasn't over-powering to us, but when you arrived it was noticeable for the first - minutes or so.  -. Food and amenities -- the hotel nickels and dimes you for amenities like internet access ($---day) we didn't use it, because both our smart phones have -G. Eating out in San Diego is expensive, and the hotels restaurant is no exception. We avoided the breakfast buffet at $-- per adult, $- - kid, and instead walked a block to the nearby Green Leaf Cafe (a business cafe) and got a decent breakfast for the whole family for $---$--. We also found that the hotels happy happy hour between ---pm was great, and during that time would split a few appetizers ($--- each vs $----- per entree during regular hours) for dinner with the kids, however most nights we didn't make it back to the hotel until after happy hour was over.  -. The pool -- if you have kids who love to swim, and are coming to this hotel to use the pool, be WARNED, there are some caveats.To save money the hotel only turns on their pool pump and cleans their pool once per week, and they do it just in time for the largest arrival of guests which is on Thursday and Friday. We arrived on Monday night, and about the first thing we did was jump into the hot tub and pool -- and in about - minutes we were disgusted (rating D-). There were arm sized clumps of human hair floating around the bottom of the pool, there was some kind of deteriorating paper item in the bottom of the pool (maxipad, diaper, or tissue -- I'm not sure but who wanted to get close enough to find out). In addition to the gross stuff on the bottom, the tops of the pool and hot tub were covered in leafs, bugs, normal pool debris, etc. The pool pump and filters were NOT running. There was a large brown bathtub ring around the top edge of the hot-tub. In addition, there were mosquitos outside, and I ended up getting bitten several times that evening, even tho we were outdoors for about -- min.  All of us who swam that night (me and the two kids) had red spots on our skin and few itchy bumps show up in the next few days -- tea tree oil was great for getting rid of these. I was ready to report the hotel pool to the del mar health department the next day.  We avoided the pool for the next few days, mostly because as our schedule had it we were slated for the beach, sea world, and legoland -- but also beacuse we hoped that the dirty pool was an oversight or the result of a broken pump and it would be better the next time. Friday morning we had a chance to check out the pool again, and it looked to our amazement, much better -- I would say a B+ rating. Friday night they had a movie showing in the pool area, which was a lot of fun -- and the pool was clean enough our kids actually enjoyed swimming in it.  Other reviewers also commented on the disgusting pool, and an fun pool so the schedule explains how both can be accurate.  -. Laundry -- there is no laundry room in this hotel that guests can do their laundry in -- very disapointing. As we expected to be able to split up and let the kids stay in the pool with one of us, while the other took care of the laundry. The hotel does have a laundry service, but given the prices of everything else there, I suspect it would have added another nights worth of cost or more to our bill to do a family of fours --days worth of laundry -- so we ended up having to leave the pool and movie, and spend Friday night at the landromat at del mar heights, and ate dinner next door with the kids while the clothes washed.   -. Shuttle: The hotel provides a free shuttle to anywhere within - miles of the hotel, which includes del mar beach -- this was the best beach we found for quality (bathrooms and changing area were amazing here) and crowd we had plenty of space to ourselves. When I called the hotel to ask about the shuttle service and other questions, the operator was fairly curt and impatient. But the shuttle service was nice -- the picked us up at a cafe we found near the beach.  -a. Speaking of the beach: the booking site we used said you could walk to the beach from the hotel. We asked at the front desk while we were there, and they said there was NO safe way to walk to the beach from this hotel, unless you wanted to walk along the interstate freeway with young kids. This seems like false advertising to me.  -. Yelp -- if you have a smart phone and a car, Yelp! came in extremely handy for finding good places with decent prices to eat. The GPS-google maps were also invaluable.\",\n",

The decor of the Washington Terrace Hotel is much nicer and the staff is friendlier and more helpful.  When I first arrived at the hotel, the bellmen were slow to help us with our bags, by the time he came out of the lobby, we were already at the door.

Not a very good first impression! However, I had no problems with the concierge when I asked the to help me find a restaurant I wanted to go to for lunch.

I waited patiently then remarked that it must be difficult to both answer phones and serve at the person checking guests into the hotel.

The Deluxe King room I had requested was unavailable, and he asked if I would mind a stand-up shower. I wasn\\'t sure what he meant, I thought he meant a room with shower stall only. I asked if I could switch rooms the next day if unhappy and he said with a wink that of course I could, but I wouldn\\'t want to since it was a very nice room.   Turns out he had upgraded us to a suite with a full living room with pull-out couch, two televisions, marble wetbar, HUGE bathroom with marble flooring, a beautiful shower curtain, and well lit bathroom counter area.

The smoke smell was unbelievably oppressive. No one had attempted to air it, Febreze it or even spray a bit of Glade.

Check out was at --AM, and we were giving a presentation from -----:-- and asked for a noon check-out.

That did not stop the young women for charging me cappuccino price for a regular coffee.

       " 'I must say, for the amount of travel I do for my job, I generally have good luck with the hotels that I stay in. Unfortunately, I cannot say that for the L\\'enfant Plaza. From the moment I checked in, I had issues.   I ended up checking in at about --:-- in the evening - upon receiving my room key, I proceeded to my room on the top floor of the hotel. Upon entering my room, it sounded as though they booked me in the engine room of a cruise ship - the room was extremely loud, and I suspect that the air conditioning unit for the entire hotel was directly above this room.   Knowing I wouldn\\'t get a wink of sleep if I stayed in this room, I proceeded back to the front desk where I was told that the only room available was a \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"parlor\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" room. If you\\'ve read some of the other reviews of this hotel, you will immediately know that this is actually a room that doesn\\'t have a bed. Wonderful... So my choices are the engine room or a room without an actual bed. I chose the latter....  Up to this room I headed.... The room was quite large, with a dining table that sat at least - people. The carpets were stained in multiple areas, and there were a number of cobwebs on the light fixtures. Again - I\\'m not too pleased with the room, but they had promised to move me to an actual room the following day. Since I was tired, and the only thing that they\\'d end up doing for me is putting me in another parlor room, I sucked it up and stayed in this room.  To the hotel\\'s credit, they did move me to a suitable room the following day and did comp me a breakfast in their restaurant. The room that I ended up in after the first night was clean, but as many others have commented, this place needs a significant remodeling - the place reminded me of a late ----\\'s Marriott.  I was attending a conference at this hotel, and must also mention two things. First of all, the first day of the meeting, the air conditioning in the conference room was not working sufficiently. Many in attendance were visibly uncomfortable from the heat and humidity (myself included) - it made it difficult to concentrate. Also, the cellular and wifi signals in the conference rooms are non-existent. When you exit the room, the signal is fine in the foyer, but poor in the actual room. This made it difficult for me because I had a couple of calls I was expecting, so I found myself nervously exiting the room regularly.  One last experience I must mention... On the second night, I visited the bar and had a couple of drinks. When ready to retire for the evening, I asked for the bill and noticed that I was overcharged by one drink. When I brought it to the attention of the bartender, I was met with arguing that I did, in fact, have the drink in question. I like to consider myself a trustworthy person, and for the bartender to argue with me and question my truthfulness was an insult to me. I wasn\\'t trying to scam him out of money, nor would it have been any skin off his back to just correct the bill. Knowing that I wasn\\'t getting anywhere, I ended up just paying for the extra drink and leaving a lousy tip. He argued his way out of his tip.....  If I ever have to attend a meeting at this hotel in the future, I will probably stay elsewhere and use the Metro to get to the L\\'enfant - the Metro is actually conveniently located under the hotel, which makes getting around town quite convenient.  My recommendation - stay away from the L\\'enfant Plaza Hotel until significant changes are made to this property.',\n",

When we arrived we even found a lovely hair in one of our beds, however, while we were there, the room got cleaned pretty well. There was actually a couple of times that the hot water seemed to be running short. And the walls were paper thin. It was possible to hear other occupants in their rooms.   Their website said they did not provide breakfast, so we were pleasantly surprised when we found that coffee and honeybun type pastries had been sat out in the main lobby on a couple of mornings.   We made this trip strictly for a Price is Right experience. So under this premise, we found the motel very lacking in some areas, yet quite sufficient for the price that close to Hollywood and Beverly Hills. I would be more than happy to answer any questions anyone might have about this motel or TPIR.\",\n",

It was a serene, beautiful place for a nightcap.  Front desk personnel were always friendly, engaging and eager to help with directions. The elevators are unique and original. Perhaps they are a little challenging. The hotel is only ten floors and I was on the fifth. Lazy me would take the elevator up to my room or the roof and then take the stairs down. The hallways are completed with a thick, luxurious carpet that are easy to walk on and absorbing of sound. I kept my window open at night because I enjoyed listening to the city in the evening. Free wireless in my room was appreciated.  This hotel is easy walking distance to the convention center, Petco Park, Horton Plaza, bars and restaurants.

       " \"Just returned from a one night stay at the Westin waterfront. I would have liked to give this a -.-, but I will give this hotel the benefit of an added half-star in lieu of one less. For us, however, this was a great all around experience.  First, we went to this hotel for a one night romantic getaway- we recently got married, but havent had time for a honeymoon so it was just a brief getaway from our house which is probably only - miles away. The Westin provided a great escape. Here's a breakdown of the things I noticed.  -The lobby is huge, with a modern decor, and a open lobby bar. However despite being a very modern theme, the use of live birch trees, dark wood, and vibrant art makes it feel comfortable and not cold. This is not your typical Boston hotel, and that is one of the reasons I wanted to stay here.  - Our room was the standard size and for Boston, I have to say it was quite large. The bathroom was unremarkable, although the mirror was fantastic- it was surrounded by a light making it easy for putting on makeup, etc. The TV was a LG -- inch HD, and the picture and sound were fantastic. The selection of channels was better than most hotel rooms, and most channels were in HD. Our view was actually pretty great even though we didn't pay for a room with a view- it is an interesting perspective of Boston from that location, and we enjoyed just watching our city. The window was the entire wall. The furnishings in the room continue the modern but almost nature-feel with warm, earthy tones. The heavenly bed was, as always, heavenly.  -The workout facility was spotless with all brand new equipment. The treadmills were far better than at my own gym. The pool was small, but clean, and the hot-tub was, strangely, metal.  -Dining- we had drinks in the Birch Bar in the lobby- expensive cocktails, but the friendly bartender gave us a round for free. We had the Sea Salt french fries and they were soooo good. You get to choose a few sauces that come from the restaurant, Sauciety. I definitely recommend the Whiskey Spiked Ketchup. We ate dinner and breakfast in the room. Dinner was actually great, and for room-service in Boston, reasonably priced. Breakfast on the other hand, was the downside. VERY expensive ($-- for the standard American Breakfast). The eggs were watery and weird, and the pancakes were salty. It was included in our rate, so we werent that dissapointed.   -Service. We had simply outstanding service all around. My husband mentioned that we were there for a special occassion, and when we returned to our room from the Birch Bar, we found a bottle of expensive champagne and a plate of four delicious chocolate desserts. Room service was prompt, and when we requested extra pillows, they were there in under - minutes. The bartender downstairs was great, and check-in and check out were efficient.  So the bottom line- I would not recommend this hotel for tourists because of the location, though if you get a good rate, I would go for it. Also, in warmer months, it really wouldnt be that bad to walk places. We paid --- for the room which included in room breakfast and a -pm checkout. The Starwood website often includes great rates, especially last minute, but it helps to know how to navigate it. However, there have regularly been affordable rates, even as low as ---. Either of these is a steal for Boston. I would strongly recommend this hotel for locals looking for a getaway, others looking for a more quiet location, and certainly for conventioners. It wasn't quite perfect b-c of the breakfast, and the bathroom could have been a bit larger. Nonetheless, this is a great Westin property.\",\n",

Cuff's seems to be the place to be, the bar was always packed and sometimes a little to noisy we went and sat upstairs in the hotel bar.   The location of this hotel is excellant, everything is within walking distance.   On the whole we had a fantastic time in Boston and we certainly come back here again.\",\n",
       " 'i had handicapped family and they put us in the very end of the hallway. we stayed on -nd floor the ice machine didnt work. the hallways were extremely dark and the hotel smelled like dog urine and wet dog. our room was pretty dark even with curtains open. the carpets and bedspreads had cigarette burns all over. the refrigerator made a terrible sound at night. i found small roaches in the bathroom. and asked for deoderizer to be sprayed in the room while we were gone. that didnt happen. i needed to use the business center and had to argue to get the key for it on - occasions. the dayshift had given me a receipt with password for it and the night shift says we know nothing about it. they finally gave in & gave me the key. housekeeping couldnt speak english so i had to ask the front desk for our room to smell better. the cont breakfast were dried out donuts. needless to say we went to the double t for all but one breakfast. no mgmt ever helped me out with our problems or would give in on some reimbursement. i did write a letter after we returned and got a letter back thanking me for my comments and now they knew some things needed improved on. i wont stay there again. planning another trip in oct and will be staying at the comfort inn next door',\n",

We enjoyed the Sleep Number bed in the room; very comfortable. They run a convenient airport shuttle to the hotel.   The hotel restaurant has a nice menu and a daily special.

Me, having stayed at extended stays before, was expecting them too. i brought my x-box along and thank goodness i brought a wireless adapter because it would be useless, plus the fact that when i first plugged in my laptop i realized why... they want to charge extra for a highspeed connection!!! i was thoroughly disappointed. the other extended stays all have been able to provide me with ethernet cords so far for free without trying to get extra money. that majorly disappointed me. sry extended but you need to change that. id rather pay --$ more to stay somewhere that can provide me an ethernet cord and not try to rip me off $- dollars a day for highspeed WIRELESS internet, what a joke. wireless only gets so fast. other than that the features and ammenities where great and the staff friendly and helpful.',\n",
       " \"After reading various negative reviews of The New Yorker, I was very tempted to cancel the hotel, and search for another one, I was pleased that I didn't. The taxi fare to the hotel from JFK is a fixed rate of $-- plus approx $- for the toll. Check in was quick and straight forward...staff weren't very smiley, but I wasn't planning to hang around for a chat. Security at the hotel is great, guests need to show their room key to get past. I was allocated a room on the --nd floor, there are plenty of lifts. The room was a double-double, side view, a double-double room does make the room appear a bit smaller, but it's not too bad. The room was very clean, bathroom was clean, and more than enough towels are supplied. The hairdrier is quite powerful, there is only one negative thing I can think of, and that is that the shower isn't powerful, but again it's bearable. Shampoo and Body Gel bottles are supplied and replaced if necessary.  Location: the location of the hotel is fantastic...minutes walk to Macys, and The Empire State Building, come out of the hotel, turn right and than left at the traffic lights...walk for a couple of mins and you're at Macy's.   Tick Tock Dinner is to the right of the hotel as you're walking out, nice place, we had a $- tip added on at the end of the bill. Another great restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner is The Stage Door, again to the right of the hotel, cross the road. Great menu and reasonable prices, good service.  I would also recommend a cafe on --- Eighth Avenue, cheap, and the food is very fresh and prepared in front of you. Come out of the hotel, cross the road, turn left and walk for about --- mins.  The hotel does not charge to the room.   The hotel bar is pricey!!!!!!!! But does play good --'s music.  Check out - it might be worth checking with the company you've booked the hotel with to see if the price you're paying includes local taxes. Our final bill had a total of --% added per night on top of our bill. If you have time to kill before your flight, you can leave your luggage with the hotel for a charge of --c per case-bag, and the same charge when collecting your case-bag. The hotel taxi to the airport is around $--, would recommend pulling a taxi off the street for the flat rate of $--.  Overall, I would definitely stay at this hotel again.\",\n",
       " \"We stayed in the tower, less expensive, and the room was a very nice Hilton type room. If you stay in the tower, book early and ask for a room overlooking the grounds and the bay, as opposed to the interstate. Very nice pool area and being right on the bay is a definite plus. Restaurant much better than I expected at a Hilton. Great location, easy to get anywhere as long as you have a car, which is pretty much a necessity in San Diego. Not certain that I'd choose to stay there again, but I might.\",\n",

They checked us back in and gave us a room with a view, helped us find out about Amtrak, etc. As it turned out the next AM there were still no trains South (and by now a lot of people had been flying into Logan because NYC was closed) but we did find out trains were running out of Manhattan South (we needed to get the Wilmington, Delaware). It was like the Amazing Race! Everyone trying to get out of town. We ended up taking a Greyhound to NYC and were able to get a train home. It cost us about an additional $---- but it could have been worse. Only down side was the staff didn't know much about the package deal I booked which was supposed to include nightly popcorn and sodas for the kids.

I have always found the rooms clean and quiet, beds very comfortable and service attentive but not overbearing. Check in is always fast and the staff is always friendly and efficient. The colors of the lobby and rooms are very neutral but relaxing after a long days work. The bathrooms are clean and modern with great shower heads. The fitness facility is very nice with a good variety of equipment. It is a large space so you do not feel like the gym was a afterthought. The restaurant and bar are on the second floor and I have eaten here often instead of going out for dinner. Food is fresh and very good, eating at the bar is welcome and a good experience if you are a solo diner. If you are a loyal Starwood customer you will find this DC hotel vastly better than the experience at the DC Four Points, and not nearly as expensive as the W and St. Regis. Rates vary greatly depending on the season and the convention schedule. Highly recommend for business travelers.',\n",

       " 'I was very pleased with what we received for what we paid. The gentleman, Christopher, at the counter was very helpful. We did run into a flaw of not having a room with a frig and micro, but he rectified it immediately. He told me when remodeling is complete they will all have these items. The room was clean. The pool was large and the kids loved it. My husband was thrilled with the fact that an affordable motel had a fitness center. I spent a majority of time on the computer in the complimentary business center, set up in the lobby. I was able to continue to book and plan the rest of our road trip through the use of their computer. There was no additional charge for printing off the web pages. This was helpful. I would only ask them to change two things. First, you access everything from the outside, so they should not refer to themselves as a hotel, but rather a motel. Second, they should offer at least some type of complimentary breakfast, cookies, or something. Most hotels do in Austin and if they took the time to clean up the physical facility and their image, since it switched owners, it would be a final touch. Further more, I feel their extras at the price offered, put them above the other motels in their class. This should be incentive enough for budgeted travelers looking for a little more for their money. They should not trick the public by saying things like, \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"hotel\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\". That only sets some travelers up for disappointment. The same theory goes along with the breakfast, you offer so much in extras, that the first time traveler would expect \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"something\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" in the way of food hospitality.

       " 'A pretty unique, or at least different hotel by Marriott Standards, in a very central location in mid town Manhattan. Walking distance to times square, madison av and -th av, but not on a super busy street itself which is nice. Recently redecorated by Marriott and now marketed as an Autograph Collection hotel. Its certainly no ordinary Marriott hotel, this is boutique style, good small cozy restaurant, trendy and cool bar and very personal well decorated rooms with a very engaging service.  General standard of the hotel - very good to excellent  Standard of the rooms - excellent (although quite small rooms)  Lobby - small but cozy and good for meeting colleagues - friends  Restaurant - small, cozy, good food and good service  Gym - excellent  Service - very good to excellent (especially the servicing of the rooms was top notch. Seems they have a separate lady taking care of each floor)  So, in conclusion, I would absolutely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a smaller, boutique style, high end hotel in midtown. Probably more a hotel for a weekend away with your partner or for business (at least the rooms I have seen are probably not for a trip with the kids). This hotel is in direct competition with The Chatwal (Starwood) which is also nearby.',\n",

Checkin went very smooth , we got some input what room we wanted . Based on the reviews here I decided to get one away from the rail track.  This meant the back of the building with a view over Petco park, but unfortunately I could still see some of the rail track as we had a corner froom with - windows. The freight train did pass by a couple of times each night and it did not really bother us - and I am quite a light sleeper.  The location is perfect , --- m walk to the gaslamp quarter.  Parking can be done in the parking structure across the hotel for $ -- a night when there is a game on and less if there is no game. However it does not allow you to get your car in and out. This works well if you are out and about during the day and return in the afternoon in the hotel and then go out in the gaslamp quarter.  I thank the reviewer that mentioned to sign up for their Select Guest program. Do that online when you book the hotel, quote the number upon check in and enjoy complimentary fresh hot and cold beverage in the morning + a paper. You can buy bagels or crossaints to go with that and all of a sudden you have a cheap in-room breakfast.  If there is a game on you will have to wait until -- PM to get to sleep, but that is not a problem in this part of town.  The room was spacious and well laid out. Yes, the bathroom doors are still there, but you'll get used to that.   Internet access for free with your laptop at a reasonable speed.  All in all, one of the better hotels we stayed in during our vacation in SW USA.\",\n",
       " \"I must agree with the previous reviewer. We had a poor experience at this hotel. We booked a Royal Court Double Double room. When we arrived after a long drive we were told that our room wasn't ready, even though it was after the check-in time, and that we should come back in an hour. When we did return and were waiting in the lobby I had to ask whether the room was ready, it was obviously too much for a member of staff to come over and inform me.  The room we booked was supposed to have views of either Nob Hill or Union Square - ours had neither. The room was very small and felt dated. When I complained to the front desk I was initially told that the hotel was full but the manager did manage to find a different room. This room was on a lower floor and had fewer amenities than the one we booked - although we were still charged the same price. It was a larger room but it still felt dated.  The beds were incredible uncomfortable. My wife and I shared one bed and my children shared the other bed. Not one of us had a good night's sleep while we were there (three nights). When I raised this issue I was just told it was tough! The staff were in the main surly and unhelpful.  I would not recommend this hotel.\",\n",

Despite having a high level Hilton Honors priviledge card, he got a very ordinary room, surprisingly small compared to say the average high end motel room, and was told nothing else was available, when he checked in. They gave him a few complimentary vouchers for the cheapest breakfast available on site, instead. When he got to the room, it had yet to be serviced. Two days later, he returned to his room mid morning to get some papers he had left inside by accident. The keycard would not work. He ran to reception where it was reissued. It still didn't work. Long story, short - - maintenance staff members and -- minutes later, he got access to the room. Of course, by now, he was extremely late for a meeting where he had to make a presentation. They gave him a $-- voucher for his inconvenience!!!!! The room was very tired - furniture scuffed and old fashioned, drapes faded, paintwork scratched, bathroom fixtures scoured until the base metal was exposed, that kind of thing. The desk was too small to do any work on and use a PC at the same time, it had an old-fashioned TV with a poor screen. Worse, the airconditioning was extremely noisy and the thermostat very insensitive. It turns itself off for long periods, then the fan comes on at maximum warp to cool the room down in a hurry, then runs a little more quietly before shutting off. This cycle is not conducive to a peaceful night's sleep.  My first day, arriving jet-lagged from the UK, they had a water problem. I ended up having a cold shower in the morning, but there was NO water by --.-- am. Guests were told they could use the facilities in the spa building, - minutes walk away. While the water was off, housekeeping 'did' the room. How you can clean a bathroom properly and hygienically without water, nobody ever managed to explain to my satisfaction. Further, there was evidence of remedial repair works going on around the accommodation blocks, and the nearest elevator to the room was out of order for the whole of my husband's -- night stay.  This hotel has a large pool and water activity based leisure facility. This is ideal for families with children and people wanting to relax and sunbathe. If you spend most of your time here, you will probably consider the property not bad. If you mostly just use the rooms, you are unlikely to be impressed. The best feature, to me, was a reasonably comfortable bed.  While the front of house staff were polite and embarrassed at the shortcomings, and claimed they wanted to help with the problems we encountered, they didn't actually achieve much or offer anything positive or genuinely meaningful to alieviate the situation. The other staff members we encountered - housekeeping and ground staff - seemingly spoke little or no english and just put on a smile because they had been trained to do so.   Not our usual Hilton experience.\",\n",

No bathtub, but with a shower this nice, we never missed a tub. Had all the amenities we needed and they were nice quality as well. I almost never think there are adequate blankets on the bed but there were here. And the breakfast was much more than we hoped for by the description of 'continental breakfast'. There was an omelet station where you could choose from fresh ingredients and have it made to order, plus biscuits and gravy, waffles, tons of fresh fruit, yogurt, cottage cheese, and all the other cereals, muffins and pastries you would normally expect. The only downfalls were some cosmetic repairs that needed attention, both in the halls and our room, and the tv really needed updating. We had a remote held together by tape that only worked some of the time. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would have a hard time finding anything even half as nice for the price.\",\n",

There is the subway on the corner and plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. The High Line is not far away and certainly a nice place to stroll.  The stairs seem to be getting steeper or perhaps I am getting older! It is great to know that when you finish the climb that you have your own haven in bustling NYC.

Two bathrooms was a plesant bonus.  HOWEVER....  The air conditioner-heat didn't work and soaked the floor. Housekeeping didn't thoroughly clean the room. The Keurig had two used pods in it. The garbage had someone else's smelly socks in it. Don't want to think of what else might not have been cleaned. The staff was less than helpful and didn't apologize when issues were brought to their attention. No one offered assistance with the luggage. Valet told me it would be ten minutes to get my car. I gave them more than twenty and they still hadn't gotten my car. Overall the location of this hotel should place it in high demand but the staff, cleanliness, and overall experience are disappointing. The only low point to my entire trip to Boston was this hotel. Didn't bother to try for any amenities as they were ridiculously overpriced.   Also if you'll notice management's responses to all the complaints on this site are the same.

       " \"Our trip to visit Washington, DC was from ---- to -----. We stayed in a deluxe King nonsmoking room at the Omni Shoreham that was located in the West wing on the seventh floor. We had a view to the back of the hotel over the pool. I had found a special for $--- a night through Travelzoo and booked directly with the hotel. The room was not large, but was comfortable enough. The rack rate on the door was $---. A small fridge was in the TV cabinet with drawers was convenient. Beds were great. The bathroom was compact but there was a short shelf under the sink to use and a shelf over the toilet. Tub had a short shelf on the back and had a curved shower rail so it was fine; nice showerhead. TV reception would be great and then go snowy at times. The small walk-in closet did not have a light so I made good use of the flashlight I packed. Good size safe in the closet for my small laptop and small purse. Glass knobs on bath and closet door, and a full-size mirror on the closet door but we usually had it open. I had to ask the housekeeper for robes and a foam pillow the second morning of our stay, and she had this for us when we returned to our room later. Being a Select Guest was wonderful with coffee and hot tea every morning, and we opted for a bagel or English muffin ($-.-- each) that kept us going until lunch later in the day; a few times napkins-silverware was not provided and on two mornings the bagels were old, tough and rock hard (only complaint we really had). One day we ordered some snacks in the evening, and room service brought them to us on a table in the room so we felt special. We had a few desserts from Morsels we had bought downstairs. Internet signal was weak and an Ethernet bridge was provided, I ended up using my data card I have which was faster. We ate at Robert's in the hotel once for dinner and it was very good. Staff and service was excellent from the bellmen, check-in-front desk, concierge, maid, room service, and engineers. Staff responded promptly to concerns or questions when contacted. The hotel lobby is grand, the roses changed several times during the week, and the lobby floor shines immaculately – definitely impressive! Our room was very clean. The bath rug was removed and missing a few days, so we asked for another one. We spilled coffee one day on the carpet by the bed and the next day asked housekeeping to clean, which they did while we were gone during the day and you could never tell it was stained or even damp. We were favorably impressed by staff at this hotel, and believed it was four diamond quality. It cost us $-- plus tip to get to the hotel via cab from National airport (you have to get in line to obtain a cab which can be confusing), and $-- plus tip back from the Omni through Abe's sedan and shuttle service the concierge booked for my husband and I with luggage. We were aware of the loud air conditioner and heavy noisy doors from prior Trip Advisor reviews so that was no surprise. We experienced slow elevators once during our two week trip. Many times during our stay the hotel was extra busy with different conventions going on. Everything was still handled quickly which impressed us, despite the number of guests we saw in the lobby and hallways. We loved the hotel and if returning to Washington, DC area would definitely stay here again at the Omni Shoreham. We heard some stories from other people we met during our trip about other places they stayed which were more expensive and poor quality in comparison.   The metro is close by and convenient to the Omni. We purchased Smart Trip cards ($- each) at Metro Central (about three stops from Woodley Park so it costs $-.-- to get there) and I put on $-- for my card and $-- for my husband's card (he is a senior so his fare rates were half price). We still had some money left on the cards after two weeks. You can go to the website metroopensdoors.com to get directions from Woodley Park to wherever you want to go which is convenient. The Smart Trip cards also get you on some local area buses, including the DC Circulator that we used to get to Georgetown.   We did the Grayline Double Decker (hop on and hop off) tour bus that stops across the street from the hotel – you have two days to use your ticket and we LOVED this bus tour! Excellent and highly recommend it. We liked it so much we did a six-hour tour on another day with Grayline to go see Mt. Vernon (go to Union Station before - AM to buy your ticket and board).   Our first 'tour' vendor we had tried on our second night was through Royal Trolley to see the monuments in the moonlight - it was a big disappointment as not enough folks to run the trolley so they put six of us in a van; another couple who had done this type of tour in the past with other vendors said it was 'okay' but not great like they had experienced before. I would recommend using another vendor if you want to see the monuments at night – and consider one with a guide that stays with you to explain things as we sometimes did not know where to go after stopping to get out as this was our first time in Washington, DC.   Places we would not recommend or go back to eat in the neighborhood: We tried the Lebanese Taverna on Connecticut one night, but were disappointed except for the few lamb kabob pieces and bread that were good – neither my husband or I would recommend going there and it was around $---person. We tried the Café Paridiso on Connecticut Ave. the first evening we arrived that others had mentioned on TripAdvisor but were disappointed and would not return.   Favorite places to eat in the neighborhood close to the hotel - Open City Café across on Calvert Street. Petits Plats around the block on Connecticut Ave. is excellent – we ate there our last night; order the 'floating island' for dessert. Petits Plats also has rotisserie chicken you can order for take out too we found out. We ordered Chinese take-out once (lunch specials and soup) from the Eddie Cafe across on Calvert (but address says Connecticut Ave) and were favorably impressed and recommend. Chipolte's is on Calvert across the street too - good Mexican food and guacamole-chips for a reasonable price - we ate there several times. We had McDonald's a time or two that is on Connecticut just to keep our meal budget in line and they were surprisingly good too (they are downstairs which is different and we would take our meal or hot fudge sundaes back to the hotel). The CVS pharmacy on Connecticut has cookies, chips, sodas and water and is convenient about a block or so away from the hotel. We bought items and sundries quite a few times at CVS which is conveniently located. A dry cleaner is next door but we brought enough clothes for our entire trip; if you were there on business it might be handy to know it is nearby, however.   There is a place in DuPont circle that says they have the 'best' cupcakes in a window when you walk by and you go downstairs – we bought four and the red velvet one was terrific with cream cheese frosting! If you spot this little bakery shop for cupcakes, be sure to stop! It is not far from the Grayline Hop-on, hop-off Double Decker tour bus stop in DuPont Circle.   Our favorite place to eat in Washington DC that we highly recommend (worth the trip) is the Old Ebbitt Grill (a historic landmark since ----) at --- --th St. near the White House in Washington – we were there for lunch twice and breakfast once – excellent food, good prices, and amazing atmosphere whether inside or in the patio area. We also ate at Fago de Chao at ---- Pennsylvania Ave. (near the Old Post Office Tower); it is a Brazilian steakhouse that is pricey but great service and good food – a treat but will run you $---person plus tax and tip. We ate once at McCormick & Schmidt on F Street in Washington which was very good. We ate lunch once at Ella's Wood Fired Pizza which was good. The Chart House in Alexandria was enjoyable with great food. We also liked the buffet at the Garden Café in the National Gallery of Art at -th and Constitution N.W. which filled us up for the afternoon activities.   One of the best maps we used was 'Washington: The Nation's Capital' that you can obtain from the Park Service at the White House Visitor's Center. We took several with us, had some others, but wore this map ragged until it fell apart as it became our favorite to get around, and we went back to get more.   The International Spy Museum is great and worth the price to visit. Be sure to see the FD Roosevelt memorial too on the tidal basin (between the Jefferson and Lincoln memorials). If you want some good bargains, ladies will enjoy Filene's Basement to shop. We explored Alexandria, and Georgetown (check out the canals there in Georgetown) as well as Washington, DC. We even visited the zoo which is free the first day we were there and got to see the Orangutans go across the 'O line' which was amazing. Check with your representative a few months ahead of time to book a White House tour, the Library of Congress (amazing), and the Bureau of Engraving. The Omni Shoreham is a quality hotel to experience, and an excellent base to explore Washington, DC and the surrounding area. A wonderful and memorable trip for us – the fall leaves made it even more spectacular!\",\n",

Plus, a walk down Spring St. and you are right in the heart of SoHo. We had the breakfast package and the buffet was small, but had everything you needed and was nicely done. We never did get around to checking out the pool so I don't know what it was like.  The service was top notch at check-in and they were very accommodating when we had to check out early because of the weather. The hotel was also very welcoming to kids, with complimentary warm milk brought up at night and our sofa bed made daily.   The only downsides, and they are minor, is that there is no free wifi, which drives me crazy, and the bathroom was not very private. The toilet area is surrounded by frosted glass and is essentially open to the rest of the room as there is no door on the bathroom. I know this design trend was popular for awhile, but I hate it.

The reason I'm writing this review is to share with everyone the fantastic and honest staff of the Sheraton Dallas Hotel by the Galleria. I specifically would like to highlight Mahom. I accidentally left my beloved David Yurman ring (a college graduation present from my parents) on the sink in the lobby bathroom. I then left the hotel and got in a cab to the airport. Mahom found my ring in the bathroom and instead of keeping it she kindly, honestly and thoughtfully set it aside in the hotel office for someone to claim. As I was pulling in at the airport I realized I didn't have the ring and called the hotel. Mahom answered and told me she had found it and it was there waiting for me. The cab driver turned around and took me back to retrieve it. I cannot thank Mahom enough for reunited me with this very sentimental and valuable piece of jewelry. I would have been heartbroken to have lost it and I cannot thank Mahom enough. Mahom and the rest of the Sheraton Dallas Hotel staff are a fantastic group of people and I highly recommend the hotel to anyone staying in North Dallas. Thank you again, Mahom, and I will certainly stay at the Sheraton on my next Dallas trip.\",\n",

I tried to take as many pictures as I could, so it might be easier to look at those rather than me going into detail about each room. A couple of things to point out though is that there is a full kitchen and a pool table, and the balcony is HUGE and overlooks downtown. If I remember correctly, when I made the reservation they stated that this is the only room that is modern. The other rooms are very traditional (but still gorgeous!).   We ate dinner at the French Room and weren't disappointed. The service was spectacular and the food was exquisite. I also highly recommend the Rodeo Bar for a lighter meal.

Also in order to see myself when I shaved I had to have my left shoulder partly in the hall outside the door (and I am a small guy). The room was small, but everything was new and the bed was quite nice. Really only room for one person to sit at the desk and a second person would have to sit on the bed to read, etc. While almost claustrophobic by American hotel standards, the room was in line with many we have stayed at in Europe. In fact most of the clientele seemed to be from outside the US based on the wide range of accents heard in the lobby. The room rates were quite good for a hotel in NYC. The discounted parking rate at the garage - block over was also excellent for NYC.  The location is pretty good. You have to walk over - avenue and down - blocks to catch one group of subway lines (metro, underground), and - avenues over and - blocks down to catch another group of subway lines. You are about a block away from -th Ave and a bit closer to Broadway (not shows the street). There are coffee and tea shops nearby and quite a concentration of US southern-style barbeque restaurants nearby.   In summary although we “paid for our stay using our hotel points, the rates were good for NYC, but the room and bathroom were small by US standards and the hotel is pretty close (----- min walk) to subway lines.

Had some great tips for inexpensive places to eat too.  Downside - the elevators, there are three of them, but they aren\\'t that reliable. We got trapped in one for over two hours, and when finally we got out, no apologies from any of the staff or management. There seemed to be a lack of awareness as to how long we were trapped and no check to see if we were ok!! Perhaps thats the pretentiousness of the hotel?  In short if your looking for something hip and trendy, with prices to boot then you can\\'t go wrong - this is not like a standard chain of Marriott or Hiltons, and made for a refreshing change',\n",
       " 'This hotel has a lovely lobby and an excellent location. The decor is nice and the Library Bar and Hudson Bar are both very welcoming. However, I was there for three nights and they put me in three rooms trying to find one that had a livable temperature. The first room started out at -- degrees and then they fixed it. After that it was -- degrees and would not get cooler. The heating-cooling unit blew hot air no matter what the thermostat was set to. The next room had a heating-cooling unit that would not work. If you turned it on the thing would make loud clanking noises all night. We left it off and they moved us to a new room the next day. That room was ----- degrees with the heat off. If you tried to turn the AC on, the air was luke warm and did nothing to cool the room. Also, this room was on the top floor and much larger. However, the water in the bathroom was rust colored each time you turned it on. It was a shame because the location was terrific and I really liked what they were going for in the space. You can find something more reliable if you look and, in the end, the concept was not worth the unreliable service and lack of comfort.',\n",
       " 'My family and I stayed at Hotel Indigo over the Holidays, and I have to say we thoroughly enjoyed our short stay. We found the decor at the Hotel absolutely lovely; the color scheme used throughout the Hotel definitely puts one in a good mood, and the staff and management were always courteous and cheerful (big plus in my book). There is also plenty of parking (no charge) and the Hotel is walking distance from shopping and restaurants (Galleria). We stayed in a suite that had an amazing layout - the sitting room is separate from the bedroom, so it was nice to watch TV, while other family members enjoyed some privacy in the bedroom. We also liked the huge bathroom, which had some pretty fantastic Aveda products (A+), and we especially liked having an extra blanket in the sitting area, and a small mini fridge to store our drinks and snacks. We definitely would recommend this Hotel to others, it is in a perfect location for shopping and fun!',\n",
       " 'We picked this hotel because it earned four stars on Hotels. It would be four stars ... in Fallujah, perhaps or maybe Kabul.   The first room they showed us had no lights. We would have had to dress by the light of the TV. There was a toilet sitting in the hallway and the whole floor had the atmosphere of a jail.   When we complained, we got another room that had lights, but smelled like a moldy towl and had a torn and stained carpet.   Even though we prepaid for our room, we left and stayed at a Holiday Inn several miles away. It cost us double, but it was worth it.',\n",
       " 'We have stayed at the Whitehall numerous times. It has a perfect location for the Near North. Close to great restaurants, shopping, easy in and out. In fairness, the hotel is currently undergoing a much needed rehab. However, we were not notified of this when we made our reservations. The lobby bar and lounge is shut down, making the lobby basically non-existent. The air conditioning on the lower floor was not functioning. The staff, were obviously uncomfortable in the record breaking heat. Our room was on the --th floor, but it did not escape a coat of dust on all the furniture, presumably from the construction on the lower floor. We had to get new keys three times in four days, due to their not working. The in-room safe was broken, one of the phones was out of order, we needed to request another hair dryer as the one in the room did not function. Overall, the place is not what we had experienced in the past. We will stay there again, only if and when the renovation is complete.',\n",

       " 'First and foremost, we got an amazing deal via hotels.com for about $--- a night for a --- sq ft, - room suite - THE LUXOUMBERG SUITE. I went to the Fairmont website to see what these rooms would have been if I booked direct and it was a whopping $--- a night.   We were in the Main Building and I would have loved the views from the new tower, but what it lacked in views it made up in style, comfort and amenities.   Just wandering the hotel, you get this great feeling of oppulance, history, and wealth.   I heard some weird fact that every US President from FDR that has visited SF has always stayed in the Fairmont. I can certainly see why. The lobby is not trendy, or sexy, but it is grand and full of the finest marble. There must be -- different little couch areas to just to sit with a drink or wait for someone.   Please promise me you will visit the in-house TONGA ROOM bar and restaurant, at least for a drink. It\\'s quite a scene! Great place to have a Mai Tai before you head out. There is this feature where they make it rain and a band plays on a moving boat. I felt like I was really in Tahiti. (even though I had never been) Also worth a drink is the Top of the Mark Bar and Lounge right across the street in the Intercontinental hotel. One minute I had amazing views of all of SF, and the next minute we were encompassed in fog.   Do like I did and sign up for the President\\'s Club for free, before you check inn. It will get you free internet, gym usage, and a daily paper. You can do it at the Fairmont website.   My only problem and it\\'s not the hotels fault, is those darn hills! Some say it adds character to the city; I simply find it annoying. I\\'m -- and in decent shape and I was huffing and puffing when returning from a dinner of bar around the area. They are more like little mountains. I felt like I was a Sherpa at time\\'s with my wifes bags from shopping.

We had a late flight (--pm) and the bell desk was happy to hold our bags until about -pm. In fact, he also got us a Fairmont House Car - Luxury Sedan to take us to the airport, rather than a regular cab for the same price.   Overall a great hotel.

The only downside was that the suite was actually a smoking room, which did smell initially, but you soon got used to it!

       " 'We were visiting Boston for one night -- attending a Red Sox game - prior to spending our vacation on Cape Cod. Prior to booking our stay, we inquired about parking and was told parking was available at a garage next store. We booked our stay at the Buckmister as we thought a garage would be more secure than a surface lot.   Our car was broken into and items taken sometime during the night. Both the garage and hotel disclaim any responsibility. The parking garages policy of closing one hour after the game basically means the employees go home at such time NOT that the lot is secured. In fact no gates are closed, security cameras are facing backwards -- it does not appear that the garage takes reasonable care in protecting the overnight cars.  The hotel claims that they simply reimburse the garage for the discount being given hotel guests and the hotel is not involved in the operation of the garage -- fair enough -- but it is very misleading for the hotel to represent that parking is nearby - when they know the parking is not secure overnight. They are a hotel -- they know the cars are going to be there overnight!  I would not recommend anyone stay at the Buckmister if they are traveling with a car.',\n",

The room we had had a decent size, was always kept very clean by the room maid and you could not beat the location! It is about eight minutes walking distance to the Empire State Building and once you are there you are in the heart of Manhattan and it's up to your fantasy what you will do with the rest of your time. The possibilities are endless.  We did not try breakfast at the hotel nor any of the other amenities.  Checking in was fast, efficient and friendly service. One of the bell boys was very nice and helpful while another one should take some lessons from the first guy regarding service and friendliness towards the customer.  Also walking to Penn Station is quite doable. I walked there twice, it's super easy, down the street a few blocks and make one turn and voila. Takes about ----- minutes walking time.

       " 'What a beautiful hotel and AWSOME location  Right in the middle of down town San Francisco  Located on Market street  a main road through downtown  this hotel is a very old hotel but has wonderful charm    REMEMBER THAT THIS IS PART OF THE LUXURY COLLECTION HOTELS    Valet parking is VERY expensive       tax a day with in and out privledges but we never needed our car  There is NO self parking  The valet guys and the doormen were more that willing to help you with any directions that you need   The                                 F                                 cable car will take you down to Fisherman s Warf  To pick up the car you cross Market Street to the depot  Cost is       a person and the ticket you get is usually good for   or so hours so be sure to hold onto it  The only problem with this mode of transportation is that once you get down to the Warf it is really difficult to get back  We waited over    minutes for a car to come and finally decided to walk back  It s about a   hour walk but very  very enjoyable  just be sure to get a map form the hotel before you venture out    There are alot of bums in the area which was a little wierd but I guess that you get that is a big city  They really weren t a problem   There is a lot just in the hotel area to keep you busy  The genuine cable cars run in the area which was really fun to see  Union Square is a must  Like I said before  be sure to get a street map at the hotel it will REALLY help people that have never been to the area before    Now to the hotel itself  Very nice but         the sheets are AWFUL   They felt like paper and the bed was old and VERY uncomfortable  When you are staying in a    star hotel and may be paying alot of money then why can t EVERYTHING be top of the line   We are Starwood Gold members and so we were hoping for some sort of an upgrade  When we checked in we went to the preferred check in area and were told that we were given a superior king room  Cool right    Well  wrong  When we entered the room it was a little small  understandable as to the location of this hotel and space is at a premium in the city  The room and bathroom were nice but cramped  When we looked out the window all that we could see was a part of the hotel  Brick wall with windows of other rooms  We thought if this is what gold and a                                 superior                                 room  To get gold status you have to either spend         or spend    nights in any SPG property in a years time  Not that easy   then we wonder what a normal not updated room was like  Don t get me wrong  the room was nice  it had its small problems but it was still nice    Room service which we didn t use seemed VERY expensive by looking at the menu  We visited the bar  Maxfield s to have a couple of drinks  We sat at the bar and waited several minutes to get waited on  We finally ordered and they also gave us a bowl of                                 snack                                 type chips  As we were sitting there enjoying ourselves we noticed that when people left they took the                                 snack                                 bowls and emptied part of the chips leaving some in and then refilled them    without washing them     OMG    We talked to a rude manager and he said that he would take care of it  So BEWARE of Maxfield s and the drinks were VERY expensive around       for liquor and      a beer  That was the only experience we had with dining  We did notice that the buffet in the morning was around        a person  We went to the Starbucks and the McDonalds down the street instead  There is also a Del Taco  Subway  Westfield shopping center and several other stores and restaurants in the area  Also if you are down at the Warf go to Chippino restaurant and eat  VERY GOOD     Just remember that you are smack dab in downtown and this is a great location  Just beware that if you are spending a lot of money that it s not always what you think it is  You also have to remember that you basically need to add     a day  TAX to the room for parking  We don t think that we would stay here again as I m sure that there are other hotels in the area that may be just as good if not better that we would investigate first  Don t be fooled by the name or the look  It was a great experience but not really worth it    Sorry that this review is so long but if you are about to spend the money to stay here we wanted to make sure that you know what to expect ',\n",
       " 'My husband and I stayed at the Palmer House for seven nights during the Thanksgiving holiday  Let me point out that Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House   a New York outfit bought it a couple of years ago  They re undergoing a huge      million renovation and the                                 Chicago                                 charm is being killed off in favor of                                 New York New York                                   No offense  but if I want to go to New York City  I ll go    I have stayed at the Palmer House dozens of times in the last    years  The last time prior to this visit was in       We decided to give the Palmer House one more try  While the      visit certainly lacked lustre  this visit was awful  I remember the graciousness of the hotel  Seeing all the staff happy and better yet  happy to see you  Now   we got the distinct impression we were a bother  The bellmen  and I use the term loosely  look at you when you walk it like you re cramping their style  We saw older guests lugging their cases up the steps  while the                                 bellmen                                 yacked on with eachother   In the entire week we were there  no one opened the door for us   no one greeted us  Shame on these new owners  Don t they know the first thing about customer service  First impressions  Evidently not   The first room they gave us had a terrible stagnant water smell coming from the bathroom drains  It was horrible and kept us up at night  Furthermore  the carpet had not been vacuumed and the bathroom floor and mirrors were not clean  We had to call housekeeping three times  Each time they would come  they didn t correct the problems  We gave up  We tried to change rooms but were told the                                 We re completely sold out                                    line  We made our reservations for this trip in July   We re Hilton Honors members   who cares  Anyway  the next day  we changed rooms and while the room was better  we still experienced problems with water  for instance  on two mornings  the water ran brown with silt  Not good   The restaurant                                 Lockwood                                 did not open until Thanksgiving Day  despite being advertised as opening weeks before  We made reservations there for dinner several weeks prior  I must say  the retaurant is terrible   The whole layout stinks  The ceilings are far too low  the tables are bare  no table cloths  no flowers  no candles  Stark  The flow of the restaurant is tangled at best  No one knows which way to go while making their way to the buffet  which is situated at the far end of the long and narrow restaurant  It s a zig zig game getting to and from  Not only that  but we ate there for breakfast each morning  simply because our rate included it  and the congestion at the buffet and lack of service was miserable  There are plenty of waiters hanging about  but I don t think the manager has told them what to do yet   No salt and pepper shakers and silverware one morning  No coffee the next morning  Funny enough  we spoke to the manager of the restaurant and he admitted to us that the restauarnt had been designed by people who had no restaurant planning experience   No kidding  I d avoid this place  To think the hotel closed the wonderful French Quarter Restaurant and opened this     Unforgivable   One more thing about this restaurant  The weird music choice  Who wants to hear Janice Joplin while eating Thanksgiving Dinner   or any other time for that matter   The music was awful  Rap  New Age  Rock  ect  The manager said they were playing the staff s CD s  Wwhhhhaaat      For a good restaurant  try Petterino s  The South Water Kitchen  WONDERFUL    and Harry Caray s  There s also a Corner Bakery that serves good coffee  sandwiches and pastries   Lastly  the decor is no longer tasteful  The lobby looks awful with a bar sticking out in the middle and massive yellow chairs obstructing the once lovely view  There are people guzzling drinks and half eaten plates of food cluttering up tables   in the lobby   Dreadful  No relaxation there at all anymore  You cannot even walk through it  It s a circus  The carpet choice on the floors we were on    and then    is hideous  I describe at as the                                 stone out peacock of pinball wizardry                                  I have a feeling Potter Palmer would flip if he saw this mess   What are these new owners thinking    A staff member told us the new owners also bought the old Carson Pirie Scott building directly across the street  which closed in February  I shutter to think       Well  with Marshall Field s selling out to Macy s  Carson s closed the Berghoff Restaurant closed  Trader Vic s closed and now the Palmer House in complete shambles       Chicago is sinking fast  We sure hate to see it go      What s next  are they going to raze Wrigley Field now  They seem to be the last man standing  Good bye Chicago   We did decide on one thing  No more Hilton Hotels for us  Even though Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House  their name is still attached  We re sticking with Marriott  who is fabulous   We made the switch after our Palmer House trip three years ago   There are plenty of hotel choices in Chicago  We stayed at the Marriott Renaissance last year and it was great  If we ever get up the nerve to come back to Chicago  that s where we ll be staying ',\n",

       " 'The property itself is clean  well presented and well maintained  However  for an airport hotel  and a property which does a great deal  of it s business with flight crews  it certainly does not go out of it s way to ensure that the crews are indulged    We are Marriott Rewards customers  albeit the basic level   and were assigned a room on the ground floor   with a very narrow door  making  it hard to push our luggage through  This was almost laughable since the rooms on the opposite side of the hall had standard sized doors    As other reviewers have noted  internet access is charged at        plus tax per day     and parking is      So  a relatively inexpensive  room rate is pushed up substantially by the add ons  So  if you have no car  and no need to use the internet   then this hotel is a relative bargain  if you need those accoutrement then the price rises  rapidly   and I would recommend the Doubletree down off of Sepulveda   The other matter I took issue with during my stay was the large gathering that was held the morning of our departure  Since we were on the ground floor  and since there was an entry exit at the end of our hall  it became very noisy in the morning as the group filed in  and furthermore  many members of that group were smokers so the hall was quite malodorous by the time we departed  Apparently  no effort was made to prevent the attendees from smoking in the lodging hallways   On the bright side  corporate policy allows for a   PM departure upon  request   although that is done via the internet before one s arrival   In summary  I would like to compliment the staff   to a person  they were pleasant and affable  To the management   rather than nickel and diming your flight crews  why not bundle everything so they will want to visit your property when traveling on leisure    In all honesty  I probably would not return  More because I was disenchanted with the ground level room and the noise than for any other reason  Otherwise  it has the feel of a mid level airport hotel ',\n",

       " 'Red Roof Inn Riverwalk is about a    minute walk from the Riverwalk  The Riverwalk can t even be seen from the top floor of this hotel  However  if you are attending a conference and can t afford to stay in one of the conference hotels  this is the place to stay  The air conditioning works and was easily adjustable  although noisy it isn t as noisy as a cheap motel  Although it is right next to the freeway and I could see the traffic go by  the soundproofing stopped it from being a problem  The grab and go breakfast is adequate  bagels  muffins  juice  coffee  apples and oranges  Out of   breakfasts the coffee machine didn t work one day  the juice machine another day and there wasn t any fruit on another  The muffins were sugar soaked  sugar sprinkled  sugar overload but the bagels were healthier  toaster available  with a choice of spread  cream cheese and jelly  jam   The breakfast area was short on places to sit but it worked out reasonably well as business starts early  by  am  and tourists seemed to eat later  The food area was clean and I didn t see any flies   The room was large  the bed was very comfortable with plenty of high quality pillows  The bathroom was clean and although they only provided bars of soap and hair shampoo  the soap had a very pleasant almond scent  There was plenty of clothes hanging space and an iron and ironing board  The hair drier was better than some hotel hair driers I ve used  There was a safe  The room had two double beds  a dresser  with drawers and a small table with two chairs  The bedside alarm clock worked  the lightning was adequate  The coffee maker could not have been used to boil water for tea without it being coffee tainted  The tv didn t have a lot of channels and the digital signal froze now and again but you could get news  weather  a film or cartoons for the children  The pool was on the side of the hotel next to the freeway flyover but it looked clean    I chose not to have my room serviced and I was never disturbed by housekeeping   The hotel does not have an airport or conference centre shuttle  If the    minute walk is too much there is a regular bus        per trip   The nearest stores are downtown and you have to go about a mile and a half to find a non tourist supermarket  There are two  Superdrug  type shops in the Riverwalk area but you have to go further for a pharmacy   Walking in the opposite direction to downtown  San Antonio is very rundown   If I had to work in San Antonio again I would stay at this hotel ',\n",

       " 'When we made arrangements to attend a function at the nearby Smart Center  the business manager suggested this hotel as convenient to their location  and all the other dealerships on   th   It was also very reasonably priced  So I called to verify vacancies for the date we would need a room  and the room rate  I was disappointed to hear that there were no king sized beds   so we booked a full queen   and there was no room service available  I was pleased that the room rate was so low  I haven t stayed in a hotel for less than     since people were break dancing in parachute pants   and I was happy to hear that there was a pizza place that delivered to the hotel and there were several nice restaurants nearby  so I made the reservation   A few days later  I realized I had not received my confirmation email  So  to be                                 on the safe side                                  read  because my other half insisted   I called to make sure we had a room reserved  It was a good thing I did  read  yes  she was right  because there was no record of my reservation in their computer  and we did not have a room reserved  despite my phone reservation  The hotel manager was apologetic  and quickly booked our room for the original quoted rate and sent me an email confirmation   The night we checked in  the GPS eventually got us to the hotel  but using the GPS we had to drive through a residential subdivision  Ordinarily  this would not be a big deal  but this particular neighborhood has the largest speed bumps running across the road that I have ever seen  Seriously  who needs speed bumps nearly a foot high  Who needs speed bumps a foot high every    feet for a quarter of a mile  After slowly dragging the underside of our car over the third or fourth speed bump  and gritting our teeth to the sound of metal and plastic grinding against these asphalt speed humps from hell  I decided to turn back and find an alternate route  The GPS found one  by going only one block further  and it took us directly to the hotel parking lot  without any speed bumps      We arrived at      pm  we had changed time zones on the drive   and the clerk quickly got us checked in  We were disappointed to learn however  that all of the nearby restaurants  bar and grill places  even the fast food joints  cater specifically to the nearby businesses and as a result  all of them  and I mean all of them  closed at   or   pm  Because it was a week night  even the pizza place closed early  In short  there are only   places within several miles to get any sort of food in this area after   pm  Mc D s  or BurgerK  So  after hours of driving  we had to get back in the car and head out for a paper sack full of drive thru  deep fried  greasy grub  and a couple of                                 cokes                                   As for the room  the room itself was small  but not as small as some of the hotel rooms I ve stayed in  our room was probably around    x     The kitchenette is open to the room and there is a small table separating the spaces  There is not enough room for a sofa  but there was a recliner parked in the corner  There was nothing in the room that wasn t functional or appeared to be heavily used or dirty  The ac appeared to be newer  and worked fine  The room was very clean  but appeared somewhat dated  We did not use the appliances  except for the refrigerator and the coffee maker  both of which worked fine  the coffee was awful however bring your own if you can   The bathroom was very clean and it had a full size tub with a shower  The water pressure was good  and there were no problems with temp fluctuations during bathing  Oddly  there was no shampoo in the shower  and when we noticed this the next morning we remembered that a guest came down while we were checking in to get shampoo  Maybe shampoo is provided upon request or something like ketchup at the McD s drive thru     The bed was very firm  I had no problem  but the wife didn t sleep well because it was too firm for her   The pillows were the typical synthetic  non allergic spun polyester type  which should make all of the asthmatics in your party giggle with glee  but if you use just one pillow  your head will sink to the mattress   which I suppose could also be an issue for stomach sleepers      The next morning  We looked out the window to find the parking lot nearly completely empty  and commented on the fact that we never heard any sounds from outside of our room  With the exception of the repeated  high pitched  angry screaming and squeals of someone s precious little darling outside our door                                 No   I want the     something or other                                  as we packed up to check out  we never heard anything from the adjoining rooms or the hallway  So noise was generally not a problem   Checkout was easy  and took all of twenty seconds  We were not disappointed with the hotel for the amount it cost for us to stay there  We probably will not stay there again  because we honestly don t really have a reason to return to the area  I think for a business professional who doesn t have an expense account  and isn t reimbursed by his or her crooked employer for overnight stays in this area however  it would be a good  inexpensive option  as long as you are able to hit the nearby restaurants before  pm  you double check your reservation  bring your own pillow  coffee and shampoo and you don t expect the four seasons or the fairmont for

the top  the details are all below   Summary                 Cons     beds were small  ac was noisy  rooms smell of vapor rub    avoid the pool and hot tub Sunday evening through Wednesday night   it s a health hazard    outdoor area has mosquitos  bring bug spray for evenings outdoors in the restaurant or at the pool area    family budget  restaurant is typical san diego prices which are expensive for a family  eat elsewhere if possible if you re on a budget or utilize the restaurants happy hour for a good deal    the food we did have was good tho     you cannot SAFELY walk to the beach from this hotel  even tho it s advertised as such  Pros     Rooms were clean  comfortable  and well appointed  Hotel was in a business neighborhood and we felt safe at the hotel     Shuttle service was prompt and helpful for trips to the beach    Pool area was fun and well designed  but only use when the pool has been cleaned     well located for access to san diego   seaworld  and legoland  The only reason we stayed here is because we got a     off deal on the room  and it was close to the beach  and it looked like the pool area would be great for the kids  which turned out to be NOT the case because the pool was so dirty during most of our stay there  I would not stay here again at the same       per night with  or full price   Details                  The rooms are decent sized  beds are comfortable  it was clean  The  queen  beds are actually doubles or very close to it    much smaller  queens  than in any other hotel we ve stayed at  The kids were accidentally kicking and hitting each other at night  The room s a c unit was very loud  not just the normal fan sound but a loud buzzing background noise as well    if you are a light sleeper that needs to be cool I would suggest avoiding this hotel  The rooms smell like vapor rub    other reviewers said that the rooms smelled  and maybe this is the hotels way of trying to freshen it up  it wasn t over powering to us  but when you arrived it was noticeable for the first   minutes or so      Food and amenities    the hotel nickels and dimes you for amenities like internet access      day  we didn t use it  because both our smart phones have  G  Eating out in San Diego is expensive  and the hotels restaurant is no exception  We avoided the breakfast buffet at     per adult       kid  and instead walked a block to the nearby Green Leaf Cafe  a business cafe  and got a decent breakfast for the whole family for          We also found that the hotels happy happy hour between    pm was great  and during that time would split a few appetizers       each vs        per entree during regular hours  for dinner with the kids  however most nights we didn t make it back to the hotel until after happy hour was over      The pool    if you have kids who love to swim  and are coming to this hotel to use the pool  be WARNED  there are some caveats To save money the hotel only turns on their pool pump and cleans their pool once per week  and they do it just in time for the largest arrival of guests which is on Thursday and Friday  We arrived on Monday night  and about the first thing we did was jump into the hot tub and pool    and in about   minutes we were disgusted  rating D    There were arm sized clumps of human hair floating around the bottom of the pool  there was some kind of deteriorating paper item in the bottom of the pool  maxipad  diaper  or tissue    I m not sure but who wanted to get close enough to find out   In addition to the gross stuff on the bottom  the tops of the pool and hot tub were covered in leafs  bugs  normal pool debris  etc  The pool pump and filters were NOT running  There was a large brown bathtub ring around the top edge of the hot tub  In addition  there were mosquitos outside  and I ended up getting bitten several times that evening  even tho we were outdoors for about    min   All of us who swam that night  me and the two kids  had red spots on our skin and few itchy bumps show up in the next few days    tea tree oil was great for getting rid of these  I was ready to report the hotel pool to the del mar health department the next day   We avoided the pool for the next few days  mostly because as our schedule had it we were slated for the beach  sea world  and legoland    but also beacuse we hoped that the dirty pool was an oversight or the result of a broken pump and it would be better the next time  Friday morning we had a chance to check out the pool again  and it looked to our amazement  much better    I would say a B  rating  Friday night they had a movie showing in the pool area  which was a lot of fun    and the pool was clean enough our kids actually enjoyed swimming in it   Other reviewers also commented on the disgusting pool  and an fun pool so the schedule explains how both can be accurate      Laundry    there is no laundry room in this hotel that guests can do their laundry in    very disapointing  As we expected to be able to split up and let the kids stay in the pool with one of us  while the other took care of the laundry  The hotel does have a laundry service  but given the prices of everything else there  I suspect it would have added another nights worth of cost or more to our bill to do a family of fours   days worth of laundry    so we ended up having to leave the pool and movie  and spend Friday night at the landromat at del mar heights  and ate dinner next door with the kids while the clothes washed       Shuttle  The hotel provides a free shuttle to anywhere within   miles of the hotel  which includes del mar beach    this was the best beach we found for quality  bathrooms and changing area were amazing here  and crowd we had plenty of space to ourselves  When I called the hotel to ask about the shuttle service and other questions  the operator was fairly curt and impatient  But the shuttle service was nice    the picked us up at a cafe we found near the beach    a  Speaking of the beach  the booking site we used said you could walk to the beach from the hotel  We asked at the front desk while we were there  and they said there was NO safe way to walk to the beach from this hotel  unless you wanted to walk along the interstate freeway with young kids  This seems like false advertising to me      Yelp    if you have a smart phone and a car  Yelp  came in extremely handy for finding good places with decent prices to eat  The GPS google maps were also invaluable ',\n",

       " 'Just returned from a one night stay at the Westin waterfront  I would have liked to give this a      but I will give this hotel the benefit of an added half star in lieu of one less  For us  however  this was a great all around experience   First  we went to this hotel for a one night romantic getaway  we recently got married  but havent had time for a honeymoon so it was just a brief getaway from our house which is probably only   miles away  The Westin provided a great escape  Here s a breakdown of the things I noticed    The lobby is huge  with a modern decor  and a open lobby bar  However despite being a very modern theme  the use of live birch trees  dark wood  and vibrant art makes it feel comfortable and not cold  This is not your typical Boston hotel  and that is one of the reasons I wanted to stay here     Our room was the standard size and for Boston  I have to say it was quite large  The bathroom was unremarkable  although the mirror was fantastic  it was surrounded by a light making it easy for putting on makeup  etc  The TV was a LG    inch HD  and the picture and sound were fantastic  The selection of channels was better than most hotel rooms  and most channels were in HD  Our view was actually pretty great even though we didn t pay for a room with a view  it is an interesting perspective of Boston from that location  and we enjoyed just watching our city  The window was the entire wall  The furnishings in the room continue the modern but almost nature feel with warm  earthy tones  The heavenly bed was  as always  heavenly    The workout facility was spotless with all brand new equipment  The treadmills were far better than at my own gym  The pool was small  but clean  and the hot tub was  strangely  metal    Dining  we had drinks in the Birch Bar in the lobby  expensive cocktails  but the friendly bartender gave us a round for free  We had the Sea Salt french fries and they were soooo good  You get to choose a few sauces that come from the restaurant  Sauciety  I definitely recommend the Whiskey Spiked Ketchup  We ate dinner and breakfast in the room  Dinner was actually great  and for room service in Boston  reasonably priced  Breakfast on the other hand  was the downside  VERY expensive      for the standard American Breakfast   The eggs were watery and weird  and the pancakes were salty  It was included in our rate  so we werent that dissapointed     Service  We had simply outstanding service all around  My husband mentioned that we were there for a special occassion  and when we returned to our room from the Birch Bar  we found a bottle of expensive champagne and a plate of four delicious chocolate desserts  Room service was prompt  and when we requested extra pillows  they were there in under   minutes  The bartender downstairs was great  and check in and check out were efficient   So the bottom line  I would not recommend this hotel for tourists because of the location  though if you get a good rate  I would go for it  Also  in warmer months  it really wouldnt be that bad to walk places  We paid     for the room which included in room breakfast and a  pm checkout  The Starwood website often includes great rates  especially last minute  but it helps to know how to navigate it  However  there have regularly been affordable rates  even as low as      Either of these is a steal for Boston  I would strongly recommend this hotel for locals looking for a getaway  others looking for a more quiet location  and certainly for conventioners  It wasn t quite perfect b c of the breakfast  and the bathroom could have been a bit larger  Nonetheless  this is a great Westin property ',\n",

       " 'Our trip to visit Washington  DC was from      to        We stayed in a deluxe King nonsmoking room at the Omni Shoreham that was located in the West wing on the seventh floor  We had a view to the back of the hotel over the pool  I had found a special for      a night through Travelzoo and booked directly with the hotel  The room was not large  but was comfortable enough  The rack rate on the door was       A small fridge was in the TV cabinet with drawers was convenient  Beds were great  The bathroom was compact but there was a short shelf under the sink to use and a shelf over the toilet  Tub had a short shelf on the back and had a curved shower rail so it was fine  nice showerhead  TV reception would be great and then go snowy at times  The small walk in closet did not have a light so I made good use of the flashlight I packed  Good size safe in the closet for my small laptop and small purse  Glass knobs on bath and closet door  and a full size mirror on the closet door but we usually had it open  I had to ask the housekeeper for robes and a foam pillow the second morning of our stay  and she had this for us when we returned to our room later  Being a Select Guest was wonderful with coffee and hot tea every morning  and we opted for a bagel or English muffin        each  that kept us going until lunch later in the day  a few times napkins silverware was not provided and on two mornings the bagels were old  tough and rock hard  only complaint we really had   One day we ordered some snacks in the evening  and room service brought them to us on a table in the room so we felt special  We had a few desserts from Morsels we had bought downstairs  Internet signal was weak and an Ethernet bridge was provided  I ended up using my data card I have which was faster  We ate at Robert s in the hotel once for dinner and it was very good  Staff and service was excellent from the bellmen  check in front desk  concierge  maid  room service  and engineers  Staff responded promptly to concerns or questions when contacted  The hotel lobby is grand  the roses changed several times during the week  and the lobby floor shines immaculately   definitely impressive  Our room was very clean  The bath rug was removed and missing a few days  so we asked for another one  We spilled coffee one day on the carpet by the bed and the next day asked housekeeping to clean  which they did while we were gone during the day and you could never tell it was stained or even damp  We were favorably impressed by staff at this hotel  and believed it was four diamond quality  It cost us     plus tip to get to the hotel via cab from National airport  you have to get in line to obtain a cab which can be confusing   and     plus tip back from the Omni through Abe s sedan and shuttle service the concierge booked for my husband and I with luggage  We were aware of the loud air conditioner and heavy noisy doors from prior Trip Advisor reviews so that was no surprise  We experienced slow elevators once during our two week trip  Many times during our stay the hotel was extra busy with different conventions going on  Everything was still handled quickly which impressed us  despite the number of guests we saw in the lobby and hallways  We loved the hotel and if returning to Washington  DC area would definitely stay here again at the Omni Shoreham  We heard some stories from other people we met during our trip about other places they stayed which were more expensive and poor quality in comparison    The metro is close by and convenient to the Omni  We purchased Smart Trip cards     each  at Metro Central  about three stops from Woodley Park so it costs       to get there  and I put on     for my card and     for my husband s card  he is a senior so his fare rates were half price   We still had some money left on the cards after two weeks  You can go to the website metroopensdoors com to get directions from Woodley Park to wherever you want to go which is convenient  The Smart Trip cards also get you on some local area buses  including the DC Circulator that we used to get to Georgetown    We did the Grayline Double Decker  hop on and hop off  tour bus that stops across the street from the hotel   you have two days to use your ticket and we LOVED this bus tour  Excellent and highly recommend it  We liked it so much we did a six hour tour on another day with Grayline to go see Mt  Vernon  go to Union Station before   AM to buy your ticket and board     Our first  tour  vendor we had tried on our second night was through Royal Trolley to see the monuments in the moonlight   it was a big disappointment as not enough folks to run the trolley so they put six of us in a van  another couple who had done this type of tour in the past with other vendors said it was  okay  but not great like they had experienced before  I would recommend using another vendor if you want to see the monuments at night   and consider one with a guide that stays with you to explain things as we sometimes did not know where to go after stopping to get out as this was our first time in Washington  DC    Places we would not recommend or go back to eat in the neighborhood  We tried the Lebanese Taverna on Connecticut one night  but were disappointed except for the few lamb kabob pieces and bread that were good   neither my husband or I would recommend going there and it was around     person  We tried the Caf  Paridiso on Connecticut Ave  the first evening we arrived that others had mentioned on TripAdvisor but were disappointed and would not return    Favorite places to eat in the neighborhood close to the hotel   Open City Caf  across on Calvert Street  Petits Plats around the block on Connecticut Ave  is excellent   we ate there our last night  order the  floating island  for dessert  Petits Plats also has rotisserie chicken you can order for take out too we found out  We ordered Chinese take out once  lunch specials and soup  from the Eddie Cafe across on Calvert  but address says Connecticut Ave  and were favorably impressed and recommend  Chipolte s is on Calvert across the street too   good Mexican food and guacamole chips for a reasonable price   we ate there several times  We had McDonald s a time or two that is on Connecticut just to keep our meal budget in line and they were surprisingly good too  they are downstairs which is different and we would take our meal or hot fudge sundaes back to the hotel   The CVS pharmacy on Connecticut has cookies  chips  sodas and water and is convenient about a block or so away from the hotel  We bought items and sundries quite a few times at CVS which is conveniently located  A dry cleaner is next door but we brought enough clothes for our entire trip  if you were there on business it might be handy to know it is nearby  however    There is a place in DuPont circle that says they have the  best  cupcakes in a window when you walk by and you go downstairs   we bought four and the red velvet one was terrific with cream cheese frosting  If you spot this little bakery shop for cupcakes  be sure to stop  It is not far from the Grayline Hop on  hop off Double Decker tour bus stop in DuPont Circle    Our favorite place to eat in Washington DC that we highly recommend  worth the trip  is the Old Ebbitt Grill  a historic landmark since       at       th St  near the White House in Washington   we were there for lunch twice and breakfast once   excellent food  good prices  and amazing atmosphere whether inside or in the patio area  We also ate at Fago de Chao at      Pennsylvania Ave   near the Old Post Office Tower   it is a Brazilian steakhouse that is pricey but great service and good food   a treat but will run you     person plus tax and tip  We ate once at McCormick   Schmidt on F Street in Washington which was very good  We ate lunch once at Ella s Wood Fired Pizza which was good  The Chart House in Alexandria was enjoyable with great food  We also liked the buffet at the Garden Caf  in the National Gallery of Art at  th and Constitution N W  which filled us up for the afternoon activities    One of the best maps we used was  Washington  The Nation s Capital  that you can obtain from the Park Service at the White House Visitor s Center  We took several with us  had some others  but wore this map ragged until it fell apart as it became our favorite to get around  and we went back to get more    The International Spy Museum is great and worth the price to visit  Be sure to see the FD Roosevelt memorial too on the tidal basin  between the Jefferson and Lincoln memorials   If you want some good bargains  ladies will enjoy Filene s Basement to shop  We explored Alexandria  and Georgetown  check out the canals there in Georgetown  as well as Washington  DC  We even visited the zoo which is free the first day we were there and got to see the Orangutans go across the  O line  which was amazing  Check with your representative a few months ahead of time to book a White House tour  the Library of Congress  amazing   and the Bureau of Engraving  The Omni Shoreham is a quality hotel to experience  and an excellent base to explore Washington  DC and the surrounding area  A wonderful and memorable trip for us   the fall leaves made it even more spectacular ',\n",

       " 'We have stayed at the Whitehall numerous times  It has a perfect location for the Near North  Close to great restaurants  shopping  easy in and out  In fairness  the hotel is currently undergoing a much needed rehab  However  we were not notified of this when we made our reservations  The lobby bar and lounge is shut down  making the lobby basically non existent  The air conditioning on the lower floor was not functioning  The staff  were obviously uncomfortable in the record breaking heat  Our room was on the   th floor  but it did not escape a coat of dust on all the furniture  presumably from the construction on the lower floor  We had to get new keys three times in four days  due to their not working  The in room safe was broken  one of the phones was out of order  we needed to request another hair dryer as the one in the room did not function  Overall  the place is not what we had experienced in the past  We will stay there again  only if and when the renovation is complete ',\n",
       " 'The rooms are generous in size  very clean and quiet  For business downtown or shopping the   th Street Mall area the location is ideal  The complimentary wine   beer tastings  full breakfast buffet   evening cookies   milk are terrific ',\n",

       " 'First and foremost  we got an amazing deal via hotels com for about      a night for a     sq ft    room suite   THE LUXOUMBERG SUITE  I went to the Fairmont website to see what these rooms would have been if I booked direct and it was a whopping      a night    We were in the Main Building and I would have loved the views from the new tower  but what it lacked in views it made up in style  comfort and amenities    Just wandering the hotel  you get this great feeling of oppulance  history  and wealth    I heard some weird fact that every US President from FDR that has visited SF has always stayed in the Fairmont  I can certainly see why  The lobby is not trendy  or sexy  but it is grand and full of the finest marble  There must be    different little couch areas to just to sit with a drink or wait for someone    Please promise me you will visit the in house TONGA ROOM bar and restaurant  at least for a drink  It s quite a scene  Great place to have a Mai Tai before you head out  There is this feature where they make it rain and a band plays on a moving boat  I felt like I was really in Tahiti   even though I had never been  Also worth a drink is the Top of the Mark Bar and Lounge right across the street in the Intercontinental hotel  One minute I had amazing views of all of SF  and the next minute we were encompassed in fog    Do like I did and sign up for the President s Club for free  before you check inn  It will get you free internet  gym usage  and a daily paper  You can do it at the Fairmont website    My only problem and it s not the hotels fault  is those darn hills  Some say it adds character to the city  I simply find it annoying  I m    and in decent shape and I was huffing and puffing when returning from a dinner of bar around the area  They are more like little mountains  I felt like I was a Sherpa at time s with my wifes bags from shopping    I was a little skeptical because I kept hearing this hotel was                                 old                                 and                                 outdated                                  but all areas we looked at  including our room  showed no signs of wear and tear    We had a late flight    pm  and the bell desk was happy to hold our bags until about  pm  In fact  he also got us a Fairmont House Car   Luxury Sedan to take us to the airport  rather than a regular cab for the same price    Overall a great hotel  It seems to get an older crowd and it s not a W by any means  but it s not trying to be   If you need additional info  please contact me      ',\n",
       " 'We found this to be a great hotel with very friendly and helpful staff  The room was very spacious and quiet  both day and night  Love the free hot chocloate then free wine by the open fire before dinner  Great way to meet interesting people  That was in December so we don t kow what happens in other seasons  The hotel is situated down by the water pretty much at the end of wharf area which is a long way from the centre of the city  However  it is well serviced by the cable trams and the other street cars which regularly run close by and go back to the city   Get a   day pass for a modest sum and thats your transportation covered ',\n",
       " 'The Hotel is very impressive and the staff are extremely helpful  I booked a   x double bed room for myself and two adult size kids however only two pillows were supplied  The porter said he d have one to us immediately but it never arrived  it was our first night after a long transatlantic journey and I was too tired to go looking   I left a message next day and another pillow was there when we returned to the room  The mini bar and table top                                 weight                                 controlled tray were very well stocked  too well stocked and a great temptation but prices were ridiculous          for a bottle of water    Even if you pick something up and put it back you will be charged  I felt tea and coffee making facilities would have been an advantage but it seemed not a lot was                                 complimentary  Also the room was small enough for three adults  Having said that the staff in the hotel were extremely nice and very helpful  nothing was too much trouble  The room was spotlessly clean and the beds were turned down each night  I did feel they were small doubles though  Would I stay here again  If I became very rich and didn t have to budget then yes ',\n",
       " 'Had a lovely stay at the Iroquois recently  We asked for   double beded room and was upgraded to a suite  Service was second to none  Greeted by the lovely Bill and looked after by the even more lovely Nick  He was especially helpful and recommended some wonderful places to eat  The only downside was that the suite was actually a smoking room  which did smell initially  but you soon got used to it  The hotel itself  could do with a little updating and a duster wouldn t go a miss on the toilet lights  but thats just being picky  Complentary use of computer and printer was an excellent bonus  as was the free coffee in the morning  For a cheap and cheerful breakfast pop into the Red flame  just a few doors down  Also don t forget to tip EVERYBODY  We got told off on our return journey as we forgot to tip the door man   A wonderful  fabulous time had by all  definately stay again ',\n",
       " 'We were visiting Boston for one night    attending a Red Sox game   prior to spending our vacation on Cape Cod  Prior to booking our stay  we inquired about parking and was told parking was available at a garage next store  We booked our stay at the Buckmister as we thought a garage would be more secure than a surface lot    Our car was broken into and items taken sometime during the night  Both the garage and hotel disclaim any responsibility  The parking garages policy of closing one hour after the game basically means the employees go home at such time NOT that the lot is secured  In fact no gates are closed  security cameras are facing backwards    it does not appear that the garage takes reasonable care in protecting the overnight cars   The hotel claims that they simply reimburse the garage for the discount being given hotel guests and the hotel is not involved in the operation of the garage    fair enough    but it is very misleading for the hotel to represent that parking is nearby   when they know the parking is not secure overnight  They are a hotel    they know the cars are going to be there overnight   I would not recommend anyone stay at the Buckmister if they are traveling with a car ',\n",
       " 'We stayed for one week at the Affinia Dumont hotel in NYC and were very happy  The room we had had a decent size  was always kept very clean by the room maid and you could not beat the location  It is about eight minutes walking distance to the Empire State Building and once you are there you are in the heart of Manhattan and it s up to your fantasy what you will do with the rest of your time  The possibilities are endless   We did not try breakfast at the hotel nor any of the other amenities   Checking in was fast  efficient and friendly service  One of the bell boys was very nice and helpful while another one should take some lessons from the first guy regarding service and friendliness towards the customer   Also walking to Penn Station is quite doable  I walked there twice  it s super easy  down the street a few blocks and make one turn and voila  Takes about       minutes walking time   All in all we liked it so much we are returning in the fall two more times and will stay there again ',\n",
       " 'I stayed at Lowell during a business trip   The hotel is perfectly located in an elegant residential area right east of central park south  You just need   block to reach the underground  When in nyc  avoid midtown  too bustling   The hotel itself is very elegant  boutique size  intimate  The staff is extremely welcoming  professional yet friendly   I had a deluxe room and it was a perfect size   I will be back ',\n",
       " 'This hotel was reasonably priced and in a good location  The room was clean and bed was comfortable  The breakfast buffet was quite good    My only big complaint was the service  I have never seen such terrible service in any hotel  I am not a weekly traveler  but I do travel       times per year    I was left on hold at the front desk for over    minutes not once  but twice  This was just to ask a question  Getting the car took over    minutes  Absolutely the worst of all of them were the bartenders and wait staff at the hotel restaurant bar  It was like we were invisible  There were plenty of people working  but they were just standing around trying not to make eye contact  It was really hard to believe how bad the service was   I should mention that I stayed at this hotel a year ago and didn t have these complaints about service  I don t know what has changed  but I won t stay there again ',\n",
       " 'I just returned from a three night stay in The Belvedere  From the moment I arrived  I felt like the staff was conscious of all my needs  The check in was easy  I arrived early and my room was not ready but the staff checked me in  took my bag and assured me my room would be ready no later than   p m  When I arrived back everything was in order  The room was spacious and clean  It looked like it had been recently remodeled  The room was quiet  I was on the   th floor and there was no street noise  My only complaint would be the slow elevators  This was the only inconvenience during my stay  The location is outstanding  I went to three musicals during my stay and I was within    minutes walking time of all the theaters  The staff was friendly and offered suggestions  Even after check out  they helped me in every way possible to get my cab for the airport  In general I would give this hotel an A   I will definitely stay there on my next visit to New York City ',\n",
       " 'Simply  it s a great hotel  The staff was incredible  The views from a corner room were great  But  be ready to pay for this an adequate price  including     for overnight parking and      continental breakfast for two ',\n",
       " 'I stay at the Figueroa whenever I am in LA  It is truly charming and each room has a sense of character unlike the sterile tedium of your average regular hotel  The bar is always full of interesting people  the staff if friendly and helpful and with fellow guests from all over the world flocking to the Figueroa one is always filled with a sense of LA as a world destination ',\n",
       " 'We enjoyed the hotel very much  It is a great place to stay for the money  Rooms were very clean and newly remodeled  We were very surprised to have a fridge and also a microwave in the rooms concidering what we were paying  The best thing for me were the wonderful pillows  I have a hard time sleeping at home  I slept like a baby with those pillows  We even asked if we could purchase some pillows before checking out  The manager was so nice he checked with housekeeping to see which kind we had in our room  We were able to purchase   new pillows  I wish I had purchased    but will be back some time again  I now sleep good at home and tell friends about these great pillows  They will stay in the same hotel when ever they are traveling to San Diego ',\n",
